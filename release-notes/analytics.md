# Analytics

We are proud to introduce our new analytics dashboard to explore and visualize survey data.

## Visualize survey data

{% hint style="info" %}
Data is collected to be analyzed! Survey analytics makes this easy.
{% endhint %}

With survey analytics, survey authors visualize survey data as it comes. The application displays one chart per question summarizing count of entries. Type of chart depends on the type of collected information \(e.g. choropleth map for geographical data, pie chart for categorical data, histogram for continuous data\).

### Based on survey structure

The analytics follows the structure of the underlying survey form. Each survey page inherits an analytics page displaying question answers  for this page.

### Meta data

A meta data section appears at the top of each page. It contains information such as respondent location, date of submission, or language. 

To keep charts from one page to another, it is possible to mark charts as `favorite`  . 

## Analyze and filter

The analytics provides a way to dynamically analyze and filter data, allowing to see subset of survey data on the go. By clicking on chart sections \(for instance clicking on the `yes` part of a pie chart \), the visualization will automatically \(and efficiently\[^1\] \) update all other charts \(for instance, filter out respondents not having answered `yes` to the selected question\).

In analytics, charts are at the same time visualization tools and dynamic filtering tools
