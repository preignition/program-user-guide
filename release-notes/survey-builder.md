# Survey Builder

Preignition is proud to introduce a powerful Survey Builder to allow users better devise how information is collected.

## Workflow

Building a survey with Preignition involves 4 step: **Building** the survey, **Testing** it, **Deploying** and finally **Analyzing** it.

### Build

The first step is about composing the content of the survey. A Preview mode allows to add to the survey by simple drag and drop gesture.

Then, a detail view mode is giving access to detailed question settings.

### Test

Users can test how survey looks and behaves \(including survey intelligence like hidden questions, sections or pages\) under the test tab.

### Deploy

Once survey is good to go, user can deploy it by creating version of the survey. 

### Analyze

This part is still under development. It will provide basic figures about survey utilization \(e.g. number of surveys filled-in or average time to fill-in a survey\), as well as pre-vizualisation of survey responses.

## Highlights

### Tree view

A new tree-view allows to easily see and compose survey structure.

### Drag and drop composition

Drag and drop is the default gesture to shape the survey, either by dropping new content into survey preview canvas or reordering questions, sections or pages within the tree-view. 

### Advanced Mode

By default, only basic tools are visible to users. The advanced mode displays advanced features like hidden fields expression builder or advanced fields type. This prevents users to be overwhelmed with non-essential features at the beginning.

### Automated translation

Surveys can be translated into multiple languages. ****Users can chose to translate the survey automatically and then re-adjust translated entries.

### Powerful expression builder

Some field attributes \(hidden, invalid, required\) can dynamically depend on survey entries. An expression builder is provided to write those logic expression and test them.

### Scoring 

Automated scores can be calculated on survey submission. This is useful for instance for rapid screening of new entries.
