If you export data from the platform, you are responsible for the privacy of the exported data. Exported data must be treated in line with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Exporting your data from the platform is a sensitive action.  You need to have the necessary user rights and have signed into your account recently in order to export survey data.  If you get an error message it means that you don't have the necessary rights or you need to sign out of your account and sign in again and try again.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

From the analytics page, click on the three lines beside the survey name in the top menu

## Step 5

First select the data form that you want to export your data in. There are two choices:

**json**- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa)

**CSV**- A CSV is a comma-separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format. CSVs look like a spreadsheet but with a . csv extension. CSV files can be used with most any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets

## Step 6

Next select the type of data that you would like to export. There are three choices:

**Anonymized**- Provides the option of exporting an anonymized data set. MetaData and all feilds marked as 'private' on your form will not be exported. This is a great option for protecting personal data as long as you have marked all questions which ask for personal data as private

**Raw-** Provides the option of exporting all the data that has been collected against a survey, including MetaData and all response feilds. Great care should be taken with this sort of data.

**Humanized**- Similar to raw data, but with transalated responses and question lookups added

## Step 7

Once you have decided how you want to export the survey data, select 'Export Now'
