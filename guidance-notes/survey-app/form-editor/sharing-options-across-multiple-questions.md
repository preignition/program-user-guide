# Sharing options across multiple questions

{% hint style="info" %}
Choice based questions such as 'checkbox group' and 'radio group' require options to be defined.  Usually the options will be specific to the question.  However it can be helpful to share options across multiple questions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

There are 3 ways of defining options for choice based questions.

1. **Options list is defined per question**.  This is the default approach.  Options are specific to the question.  Options are created when the question is created.
2. **Options are shared between multiple questions.**   It is possible to share options between multiple questions within the same section.  This guidance note shows how to do this.
3. **Options are defined remotely**.  This feature will enable options to be defined outside of the Accessible Survey platform.  It is currently under development.

## Step 2

To share options between multiple questions within the same section,  select the relevant section from the form structure and toggle on the 'advanced' setting and go to the 'options' tab.

You will be able to 'create a new option group' and see any exisiting options groups that have already been created for this section.

## Step 3

If you 'create a new option group' you will be asked to give the option group a name.  Choose a name that is relevant to the options.

## Step 4

If you select 'create', you will see the new options group appear in the grid. &#x20;

Click on the downwards arrow to add your options.
