# Sharing options across multiple questions

{% hint style="info" %}
Choice based questions such as 'checkbox group' and 'radio group' require response options to be defined.  Usually the options will be specific to the question.  However it can be helpful to share options across multiple questions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

There are 3 ways of defining options for choice based questions.

1. **Options list is defined per question**.  This is the default approach.  Options are specific to the question.  Options are created when the question is created.
2. **Options are shared between multiple questions.**   It is possible to share options between multiple questions within the same section.  This guidance note shows how to do this.
3. **Options are defined remotely**.  This feature will enable options to be defined outside of the Accessible Survey platform and used anywhere in a form.  It is currently under development.

## Step 2

To share options between multiple questions within the same section,  select the relevant section from the form structure and toggle on the 'advanced' button and go to the 'options' tab.

You will be able to 'create a new option group'.  You willl also see all exisiting options groups that have been created for this section.

## Step 3

If you 'create a new option group' you will be asked to give the option group a name.  Choose a name that will make it easy to identify later.

## Step 4

Select 'create'.  You will see the new options group appear in the grid. &#x20;

Click on the downwards arrow beside the new options group to add your options.

## Step 5

Add option choices as usual. &#x20;

Because you are in the 'advanced' mode there are some additional feilds which can be completed if required. &#x20;

## Step 6

The new options group appears on the grid with the number of option choices you have created indicated in brackets. &#x20;

It is now available to be used in choice based questions throughout the section as shown in the video below. &#x20;
