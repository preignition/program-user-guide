# Adding an accessibility menu

{% hint style="success" %}
Adding an accessibility menu at the start of your survey helps makes the accessibility options more prominent to survey respondents
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

Accessibility settings can be activitated by survey respondents from the accessibility settings icon which is always available in the top right hand corner of the screen.

However adding an accessibility menu to your survey can make these options more prominent.&#x20;

## Step 2

The accessibility menu can be added to any feild that supports Markdown.  This includes the 'landing page' or a 'free text' feild within your form.

Simply copy this code to make the menu appear&#x20;

```markup
<a11y-menu context="survey"></a11y-menu>
```

The menu allows respondents to activate, deactivate or change accessibility settings directly from the menu.

It is intellegent, in that it will only show the accessibility options that you have activated for your survey.

## Step 4&#x20;

You can also add an accessibility menu as the first page of your survey but following these instructions.

Add a new page and section at the beginning of your form.  Give the page a title like 'Accessibility'.  The section should have a name but not a title or sub title&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot showing an Accessibility page added at the start of a Form</p></figcaption></figure>

Drag and drop to add a new 'free text' question into the section that you have just created.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="Screenshot showing a new &#x27;Free Text&#x27; feild being added to the form.  By dragging the question type from the left hand column and dropping into the middle section of the page."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Copy and paste the accessibility menu into the free text field.

```markup
<a11y-menu context="survey"></a11y-menu>
```

## Step 4

If you have included an accessibility menu in your form, be careful if you auto translate the form.

It will translate the word "survey" in the code, and the menu will not render properly.

You will need to manually correct the code in the translated version of the Form.&#x20;
