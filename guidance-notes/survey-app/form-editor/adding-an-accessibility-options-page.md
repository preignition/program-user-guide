# Adding an accessibility options page

{% hint style="success" %}
The accessibility options available for your form can always be activated by respondents via the accessibility icon in the top menu.  Adding an accessibility options page at the start of your form makes them more prominent.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

Add a new page and section at the beginning of your form.  Give the page a title like 'Accessibility'.  The section should have a name but not a title or sub title

&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (2) (1) (1).png" alt="Screenshot showing a new page and section being added at the beginning of a form"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Step 2

Drag and drop to add a new 'free text' question into the section that you have just created.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="Screenshot showing a new &#x27;Free Text&#x27; feild being added to the form.  By dragging the question type from the left hand column and dropping into the middle section of the page."><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Step 3

Copy and paste the following text into the free text feild.

> \<lite-youtube class="show-when-signlanguage" videoid="ybFRDhUK8p4">\</lite-youtube>
>
> \*\*\<H4><mark style="background-color:green;">Accessible Surveys has various built in accessibility features. On this page, you can select the accessibility formats that you like</mark>.\</H4>\*\*
>
> <mark style="background-color:green;">If you don't want to use any accessibility option, you can skip this page</mark>.
>
> \<pfo-accessibility-menu context="survey">\</pfo-accessibility-menu>
>
> \<pfo-accessibility-signlanguage>\</pfo-accessibility-signlanguage>
>
> \##### <mark style="background-color:green;">By activating the British Sign option, you will see the survey in the written language you selected and you will see a video version in British Sign with English subtitles</mark>.&#x20;
>
>

The text coloured in <mark style="background-color:green;">green</mark> can be customised to suit your requirements

## Step 4

The accessibilty page will pick up any accessibility modes that you have activated for your form.  It will appear to respondents as shown in this short video.
