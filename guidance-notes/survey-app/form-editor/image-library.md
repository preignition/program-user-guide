# Image Library

{% hint style="info" %}
An image must first be added to the Image Library before it can be used in a form
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

The Image Library is accessed from the Form Definition menu in the form Build mode

## Step 2

Once in the Image Library, users have two ways to add images. Images can either be uploaded directly using the 'upload images' button or dropped into the image library workspace.

## Step 3

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure your images are a consistent size before uploading them to your image library
{% endhint %}

In order for your images to good in your forms, it is important that they are a consistent ratio and appropriate size for the web. &#x20;

Your should resize your images **before** uploading them to your image library.

We recommend using square images ( 1 : 1 ratio) to accompany questions and having a file size of 400KB or less so that images load quickly, even if the internet connection is poor.

For more guidance on resizing you images, please see the Frequently Asked Question entitled '[What is the best file format for my images](../../../faq/what-is-the-best-file-format-for-easy-read-images.md)'

## Step 4

Once added the images will be displayed in a gallery format.
