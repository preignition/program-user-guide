## Step 3

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure your images are a consistent size before uploading them to your image library
{% endhint %}

In order for your images to good in your forms, it is important that they are a consistent ratio and appropriate size for the web.&#x20;

Your should resize your images **before** uploading them to your image library.

We recommend using square images ( 1 : 1 ratio) to accompany questions and having a file size of 400KB or less so that images load quickly, even if the internet connection is poor.

There are many free tools which you can use to resize your images, including [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/sp).

## Step 4

This is an example of how an image can be formated to a 1 : 1 ratio and resized to less than 400KB using Adobe Express

1. Go to [https://new.express.adobe.com/](https://new.express.adobe.com/) and either sign in or set up a new free account
2. Scroll down to 'Resize image' as shown below

3. Drag and
