# Form Behaviour

{% hint style="success" %}
Form behaviour enables you to customise your Form so it adapts to the specific needs of Respondents
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

Form Behaviour can be found in the Form Definition menu in the left hand column

## Step 2

There are three accessibility modes whch can be activated for a Form

<table><thead><tr><th width="204">Accessibility Mode</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Easy Read</strong> mode presents a simplified form interface to the user.  Parts of the form can be hidden (pages, sections or questions) and illustrations can be added.  See the '<a href="easy-read.md">Easy Read</a>' Guidance Note for more information</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (81).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Sign Language</strong> mode allows form builders to attach videos for questions which are displayed when this mode is activated.  See the '<a href="sign-language.md">Sign Language</a>' Guidance Note for more information</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (82).png" alt="" data-size="original"></td><td><strong>Voice Recording</strong> mode allows survey respondents to leave voice messages as answers to text based questions.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Once activated, these modes can be accesses from the form builder as shown below

## Step 3

The **Read Aloud** feature is activated by default. A Read Aloud button is presented beside each question. Clicking on this button reads the question aloud to the Respondent. Once entered, the Respondent's answer is also read aloud.

The feature can be deactived by ticking the box in the 'Prevented Modes' section as shown below

## Step 4

The localize option allows you to mark the form as multilingual

Once a form is localised, a 'localised mode' also appears in the form builder view

## Step 5

Layout gives the option to illustate a question with an image or video.  It also allows you to choose the positioning of the illustration as shown below

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot showing how illustrations for questions can be enabled.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend you allow for the automatic positioning of illustrations as the best position for an illustration will depend on the screen size the repondent is using.
{% endhint %}

If you activate Easy Read for your form, 'enable illustrations for questions will be activated automatically as will the setting 'Only show illustrations when Easy Read is activated'

## Step 6

The Theme settings are not yet developed. This will enable Users to have greater control over the Forms appearance by altering things like font and background colour settings.
