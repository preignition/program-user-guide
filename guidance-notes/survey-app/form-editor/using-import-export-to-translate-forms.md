# Using import/ export to translate forms

{% hint style="info" %}
The import/ export feature facilitates working with translators by making it possible for a form to be translated outside the platfrom and then imported back in.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

First activate the 'advanced' tab in the top right corner

'Export/ Import' will now appear in the Form Definition Menu

## Step 3

For the time being, 'localize' is the only type of export available.  Choose the language that you want to translate the form into and select 'Export Now'

## Step 4

A new row appears on the Export/ Import grid, with a link to download the same export file again.  Other information related to the exported item is also shown such as the User who created the export and the time and date the export was prepared.

Exported file will now be available as a downloaded json file.

## Step 5

The json file can be shared with translators.  The file contains all the fields that need to be translated, along with their respective values in the form's primary language. It also contains a series of metadata values, used to validate and guide the data import process.

Take care not to change any of the metadata values contained within the file.  These are used to validate and guide the data import process.  If these are changed it will not be possible to import the file back into the platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
The file must be work editied in a json editor and imported back into the platform in this file format.
{% endhint %}

## Step 6

Once the exported form has been worked on and the appropriate feilds have been translated, the file can be imported back into the platfom.
