It is best practice to use Tooltips sparingly and keep the descriptions short so they render well on smaller devices such as tablets and phones

## Step 1

Tooltips can be added anywhere you like in your survey by using this code;

```
<lapp-tooltip text="tooltip message">label</lapp-tooltip>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You can copy and paste the code above into your survey and then alter as explained below
{% endhint %}

Alter the following elements to customise your tooltip;

**Label**- This is the word that you want to be explained or expanded.  In the example above the 'Label' is the word 'complex'

**tooltip message-** This is the explanation of the word.  In the example above the 'tooltip message' is the text "Something which is complicated or difficult to understand'

## Step 2

The Tooltip code can be added directly from the formatting ribbon in feild that support markdown such as the 'Introduction Page' or 'Text (markdown)' feilds.

However tooltips can also be added to question labels and option labels by copying and pasting the code shown in Step 1.

## Step 3

Once you have added your tooltip you can go to the 'Test' mode to test how it is working.

## Step 6

Tooltip's can be added to option labels as shown below:

To add s Tooltip to an options label you must toggle on the 'Advanced' mode and select the option 'allow options to be written in markdown' as shown below:
