# Using tooltips

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Tooltips can be added to surveys to explain words which are complex or difficult to understand.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

It is best practice to use Tooltips sparingly and keep the descriptions short so they render well on smaller devices such as tablets and phones

## Step 1

Tooltips can be added anywhere you like in your survey by using this code;

```
<lapp-tooltip text="tooltip message">label</lapp-tooltip>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You can copy and paste the code above into your survey and then alter as explained below
{% endhint %}

Alter the following elements to customise your tooltip;

**Label**- This is the word that you want to be explained or expanded.  In the example above the 'Label' is the word 'complex'

**tooltip message-** This is the explanation of the word.  In the example above the 'tooltip message' is the text "Something which is complicated or difficult to understand'

## Step 2

The Tooltip code can be added directly from the formatting ribbon in feild that support markdown such as the 'Introduction Page' or 'Text (markdown)' feilds.

However tooltips can also be added to question labels and option labels by copying and pasting the code shown in Step 1.

## Step 3

The method to test your tooltip depends upon where it has been added.

If your tooltip has been added to the 'Introduction Page' or 'Thank You Page', it can be tested from the 'Preview'  tab as shown below;

If your tooltip has been added to your Form, it can be tested from the 'Test' view as shown below;

## Step 4

This short video shows a tooltip to explain the word 'survey' being added to the 'Introduction Page' and 'Question Label' of a survey.  A tooltip can be added to an 'Option Label' in the same way as a 'Question Label' &#x20;
