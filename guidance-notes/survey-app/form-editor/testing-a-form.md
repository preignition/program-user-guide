# Testing a form

{% hint style="info" %}
The 'Test' feature provides an easy way for you to see how your form will appear to respondents. You can try out any changes and make edits directly from the test page
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

In the form builder, the Test option appears in the top menu

## Step 2

Selecting Test will show how your form appears to respondents.

Test the form to see how it reacts. If your form incorporates logic, this is a great time to check that it has been applied correctly.  Accessibility modes can also be tested.

## Step 3

Questions can be edited directly from the test page by selecting the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (331) (1).png>)edit icon which appears beside the question when it is focussed on

## Step 4

In the test mode, several icons appear in the top menu which are useful when testing a form.  These only appear in test mode do not appear to survey respondents when they are completing a survey.

In the Test mode the top menu has the following options:

| Option                                                                          | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (2).png>)                           | View all content on the form, regardless of logic or accessibility modes              |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (3).png>)                           | Test the form in any language that has been activativated for the Form                |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (296) (1) (1).png>)                         | Activate Read Aloud                                                                   |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3) (1).png>)                           | Activate Sign Language mode. This will only appear if applied as an accessiblity mode |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (302).png>)                                 | Activate Easy Read mode. This will only appear if applied as an accessibility mode    |
| <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (62).png" alt="" data-size="original"> | Simplify the interface.  This mode will only appear if Easy Read mode is not active   |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (308).png>)                                 | Adjust the zoom level so you can see more of the form in a single view                |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (306) (1).png>)                             | Enables you to drag and drop the questions                                            |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (327) (1) (1) (1).png>)                     | Activates a 'comments' feature. This is explained below                               |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (2).png>)                              | View and clear test data so you can retest a blank form                               |

## Step 5

The comments feature ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (325) (1) (1) (1).png>) provides a powerful tool for users to collaborate when creating forms.

Users with the 'Editor' user rights to a form can comment on questions, respond to other Users comments and mark comments as resolved.

See the Guidance Note '[Access rights for forms](access-rights-for-forms.md)' for instructions about how to give your team access to your form.

## Step 6

Once you have checked that your form is working smoothly, you are ready to 'Publish' the Form.

{% hint style="info" %}
Forms must be 'Published' before they can be used in surveys. If you have changed your form in any way, it must also be 'Published' before these changes become seen by survey respondents.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations!  You now know how to test your form.
{% endhint %}
