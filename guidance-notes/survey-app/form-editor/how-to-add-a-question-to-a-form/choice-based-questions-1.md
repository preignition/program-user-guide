# Rating, Slider, Order and Range questions

## Ratings

Rating questions ask responents to rate something using a star system.

Edit the question in the same way you would a choice based question. You can set the number of stars presented and whether or not to allow respondents to select zero stars

Edit the question in the usual way.

Set a minimum and maximum for your scale and choose whether labels and ticks appear on the slider.

Slider questions (with labels and ticks enabled) appear to respondents like this:

## Order

Order questions ask respondents to order a list of options. The 'advanced' toggle must be activated before 'Order' and 'Range' question types appear.

The question label and options are entered in the same way as a checkbox group question.

This short video shows how order questions appear to survey respondents.

## Range

Range questions present respondents with a sliding scale in a similar way to a Slider question.  However respondents can specify a range on the scale rather than a single point.

The 'advanced' toggle must be activated before 'Order' and 'Range' question types appear.

The question is editing in the same way as a slider question
