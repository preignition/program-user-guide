## Which choice based question should I use?

**Single checkbox-** Respondents can check a single box.  Useful for asking respondents to give consent.

**Checkbox group-** Useful if you want respondnets to be able to select more than 1 option from a list of options.

**Dropdown group-**  Allows respondents to select a single option from a list of options.  Useful if the list of options is large and you don't want them all to be displayed initially.

Radio group- Like the dropdown group, it allows respondents to select a single option from a list of options.  However the options are displayed on the screen.  Useful if a small number of options is available.

Edit the question in the usual way and select 'options'

Under 'options' you can enter the options you want to be presented to respondents

* You can decide whether you want the options to appear on their own line or side-by-side
* You can ask respondents to specify an answer if they select the 'other' option.  You can also customise the prompt label that is presented by entering it into the 'specify other text label' field
* You can decide whether the option is exclusive or not. If an option is exclusive respondents will not be able to select other options if they have already selected an exclusive option.  They can deselect am exclusive option and choose another option.
