# Distributing your survey

## Context

Respondents will access your survey using links.  The 'Link builder' generates these links for you and gives you lots of control over the process.

{% hint style="success" %}
Links can be shared however you choose, including sharing via your website, email or social media
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

Select 'Distribute' in the 'Survey definition' menu.

You will see default links for testing the survey and for sharing the finalised survey.

The 'Link Builder' provides some additional options.

## Step 2

The Link Builder gives you a lot of control over how you share your survey.  For instance you can share a 'test' link or a 'production' link or a link with an accessibility mode already activated.

You will notice that the link changes whenever a new option is selected.   However the survey links stay the same when new verson of the survey are published so you don't need to worry about sharing new links.

## Step 3

The 'survey mode' option allows you create either a test link or a production link.&#x20;

Test links are used to test the survey before it goes live.  Respondents answers are not saved to the database. &#x20;

Production links are the links you share to get responses to your survey.  Answers are saved to the database automatically&#x20;

## Step 4

The 'survey name' option allows you to use the default link name or a more readable 'alias' which you can customised.

To create an alias link see the How to Guide '[Creating alias survey links](creating-alias-survey-links.md)'

## Step 5

The 'Survey options' you are presented with will vary depending upon whether the survey mode is 'test' or 'production'

In test mode you will have the option whether or not to display the landing page while testing the form&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (316) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In production mode you have the option to force respondents to use the latest version of the survey even if they have started answering a previous version

{% hint style="success" %}
By default respondents will not be presented with a newer version of a survey if they have started answering a previous version.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 6

If the form you are using has accessibility modes, a survey link can be generated so these are activated automatically when a respondent clicks on the link

In the example below, the 'read aloud' feature would be automtically activated

## Step 7

Click on the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (314) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)icon to copy the link to your clipboard.  You can now share it how you choose&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (304) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)
