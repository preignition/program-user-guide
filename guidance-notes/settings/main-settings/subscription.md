When you have set up a payment method, you will just see the details of your current subscription

## Setting up a payment method

It is possible to set up a payment method at any time.  However the way of doing this will depend upon whether you are in your trail period or not.

The short video below shows how to set up a payment method in both circumstances.  As shown in the video you can set up a Direct Debit with your bank or pay using a debit or credit card.
