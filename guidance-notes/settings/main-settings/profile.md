## Public Settings

Under the 'Public Settings', authorised users are able to:

1. Change the name of the Account
2. Change the default language (which is applied as the initial language to all resources created, such as Forms and questions)
3. Activate additional languages.  These will then be available for any teams associated with the organisation.

In order to make changes a user must first select 'edit' and 'save' any changes.

This 28 second video shows you how this can be done.
