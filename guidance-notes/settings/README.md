{% hint style="info" %}
The screenshot above shows how the customer portal can be accessed from the homepage by Account Holders.  If you can't see 'Customer' in the top menu, you do not have the necessary rights to access this part of the application.
{% endhint %}

This Customer Portal is currently under development.   However you can already complete key tasks like reviewing your subscription and adding members to your account or to a specific team.

The first section is labelled [‘Portal’.](main-settings/)  This is where you can view and edit the main account settings. &#x20;

The second section is labelled [‘Team’.](presentation.md)  This is where you view and edit the settings for a specific team.
