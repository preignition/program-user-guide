# Customer Portal

The customer portal allows customers to control all aspects of their account on Accessible Surveys. &#x20;

This part of the application is currently under development.   However you can already complete key tasks like review your subscription or add members to your account or to a specific team.

The first section is labelled [‘Portal’.](main-settings/)  This is where you can view and edit the main account settings. &#x20;

The second section is labelled [‘Team’.](presentation.md)  This is where you view and edit the settings for a specific team.
