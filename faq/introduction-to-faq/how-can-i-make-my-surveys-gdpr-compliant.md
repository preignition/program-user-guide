# How can I make my surveys GDPR compliant?

## Introduction

This page provides some practical instructutions our Users, to help them apply GDPR principles to ensure that their surveys are GDPR compliant.

## Make sure your survey provider is GDPR compliant&#x20;

[Article 28](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG\&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC#d1e3150-1-1) of GDPR states that:

> The controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.

It is therefore your responsibility to make sure that your data processors operate in a GDPR-compliant way. &#x20;

So if you have a Data Protection Officer, ask them to check your supplier’s (processors’) privacy and security policies to ensure that they adhere to the GDPR (here are our [terms and privacy policy](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms))

### Make sure you have a lawful basis for processing your respondent's data

The first Principle of GDPR is that personal data must be 'processed lawfully'. &#x20;

We understand this to mean that the following is in place:

1. **Consent.**  When collecting personal data your respondents must deliberately and willfully tell you that it is OK that you collect data about them, for the purposes that you clearly explain to them.&#x20;
2. **Legitimate interest.**  When collecting personal data you (your organization or company) should be able to convincingly prove that collecting personal data is in your **** legitimate interest.  ie that it’s in your (and your customers’) interests to collect feedback, data and their personal info.  For example to solve their problems, or enhance your services.

### Don't cut corners when getting User's consent

Consent basically means getting permissions for something you want to do.  Consent must be “_unambiguous_”, and in the case of sensitive data, “_explicit_”.&#x20;

This means you cannot use tactics like pre-ticked checkboxes, or trick people somehow to agree with something that they don’t really understand or haven't read.

The new law says:

> When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them

Also, your request for consent must be clear, brief and not disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.

See the FAQ '[How to write a GDPR-proof Privacy Policy for your Surveys](../data-privacy-and-security/how-to-write-gdpr-proof-privacy-policy-for-your-surveys.md)' for more guidance about how to put this into practice.

## Obtaining consent in your surveys or forms

If you genuinely feel that your research and use of data is respectful of your respondents, then don’t feel that you need to obtain consent. Just make sure you’re completely transparent about “how” and “why” you’re planing to use data in your survey process. Also give people the chance contact you for further info or to opt-out. Otherwise, you must obtain consent.

Note:

It’s important to know that once you’ve gotten consent, you can’t double-back and use another base for processing. So if a respondent does not give you permission and says “no”, you can’t then change your mind and send the survey anyway with the justification of “legitimate interests” for instance.

Keep in mind that you must records of how and when consent was given, because he GDPR says:

“the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data”

So if you decide that you need to obtain consent, here is how you can do this:

&#x20;

### For collecting non-sensitive data:

According to the GDPR, for non-sensitive data, you need “unambiguous, affirmative” consent, not “explicit” consent. Therefore, you can rely on a completely unmistakable notice along the lines for example:

“ By filling out this form you agree that we will process your data in line with our our privacy policy ”

A good place to have this information in your questionnaires is the [Welcome page](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/welcome-page/). This feature allows you to add a starting screen for your surveys or forms, which can only include data, pictures, and a button to START the survey.

This [article helps you write a proper Privacy Policy for your surveys](https://www.surveylegend.com/how-to-write-gdpr-proof-privacy-policy-for-surveys/).

![Example of a getting consent for non-sensitive data in a survey](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/tutorials/gdpr-obtain-consent-for-non-sensitive-data-using-a-welcome-page.png)

&#x20;

The image above shows an example of a getting consent for non-sensitive data in a survey, using a Welcome Page.

You provide clear information and put a note for getting consent. Note that this is just a simple example. The amount of information that you provide here and how you describe it is up to you and your research case.

Remember that you must explain personal data processed, purpose of processing, intended retention, subject rights, source of data, conditions of processing. Of course it can become a heavy start for a survey and you don’t want to scare people. So, it’s good to keep it short and add a link to your privacy policy page, or a page that fully describes your research process.

Note:

You can easily link any piece of text to external pages, for example to your “policy page” or a page that explains why and how you are doing this survey. Read more about [adding links to your survey content](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/rich-text-editing/).

&#x20;Tip:

It might also be a good idea to include a brief version or repeat this information at the ending section of the survey, using a [Thank You Page](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/thank-page/).

People may perhaps change their mind after answering all questions. So, you don’t want them to go back all the way to the beginning of the survey or reload it (and pollute your data) just to check the privacy policy page or your contact person’s info.

Sometimes we see people try to obtain the consent in the end of the survey. For instance they use a [Section Break](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/section-break/) right at the end and tell people: “If you submit, you agree with our privacy terms and give us your consent.” Like the image below:

![Example of a getting consent for non-sensitive data in a survey using a section break](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/tutorials/gdpr-obtain-consent-for-non-sensitive-data-before-submitting.png)

&#x20;

This might be a good idea for regular online forms, but when you use SurveyLegend this strategy is not good for two reasons:

1. SurveyLegend collects data as soon as respondents start typing or selecting choices. This is to ensure you will get even unfinished surveys. Your respondents might get tired and just leave before submitting the survey.
2. People might simply miss this. Because it is at the end of the survey. If the questionnaire is too long, they might not even see this; or due to being tired after answering all your questions they may not pay enough attention. So this is against the regulation which requires you to inform people clearly and transparently.

If you do it this way, you must manually [filter and remove collected data](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/deleting-individual-responses/) from “un-submitted” participations.

Of course none of these has to be included inside the survey itself. It depends on how you handle your survey process.

If you inform people via other ways in advance and have their consent, and if you are sure that they are informed before starting the survey, then don’t include them here. But remember that surveys are sent as links, so anyone can share open them! Are you sure no one outside of your target group will receive the survey?

Tip:

For analytical purposes, you might want to [collect survey respondents’ IP-addresses](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/track-using-ip-addresses/); for example to identify whether one person has participated in the same survey several times to affect the results. This feature is OFF by default in our tool, unless you manually enable it.

Keep in mind that IP-addresses are considered as personal data, particularly by the GDPR. Therefore collection of IP-addresses without asking for permission from the respondents makes your questionnaire none-compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation!

If you want to enable this feature, we strongly recommend you to explain your policies and obtain consent from your respondents, because otherwise your respondents will not have any way to know that you are collecting their IPs.

&#x20;

### For collecting sensitive data:

According to the GDPR, to collect [sensitive data](https://www.surveylegend.com/gdpr/how-to-make-gdpr-proof-surveys-or-forms/#sensitive-personal-data), you need “explicit” consent.

As we already mentioned, individuals must understand clearly and unambiguously what they are giving permission to. Therefore,you must simply articulate your request and be specific.

What is important here is that, consent should be given in the form of a clear affirmative action on the part of the data subject. In practical terms, this means asking for a positive “opt-in”. It also means that pre-ticked boxes should not be used, before they start the survey.

So, after explaining your privacy policy and how / why of your research, you can start the survey by asking a first question like this one:

Note:

Use a [Single Selection](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/single-selection/) question (NOT a Multiple Selection question).

Make this question compulsory by enabling the [Answer is required](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/demand-required-answer/) setting!

\* Is it OK for you, if we use your personal data such as your health status which you provide when filling out this questionnaire (in accordance with our privacy policy as explained in the beginning)?

* Yes
* No

Here you see that you are providing a clear “opt-in” possibility. Respondents must give you permission to use their data, since answering is required.

&#x20;

Tip:

Perhaps you want to collect several pieces of sensitive data about your respondents. Therefore, it might easily become too much and too intimidating to describe why you need to collect each of them at the beginning of the survey.

So, do we have a nicer solution for this? Oh yes!

What you can do is to simply describe the way data will be used right under the question itself. SurveyLegend has a little nifty feature called [Instructions For Respondents](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/instructions-for-respondents/). Enabling this will add a piece of text with a smaller font size underneath the question text, where you can explain why you need the data.

Also, make sure to turn on the “Always visible instructions” setting, so that your respondents won’t miss your explanation. Here is an example of how it could look like:

What is your full name?

We need this to be able to verify your membership at our institute.

What is your email address?

We need your email to be able to send you information about your results of this survey.

What is your ethnic origin?

This information helps our organization to have better marketing campaigns and external communications, reaching the right audience.

This way, you are not only more transparent and more clear about your use of their data (which is in accordance with GDPR regulation), but also, it is easier for a human brain to process the information. It will be less scary and less intimidating to answer your questions.

***

#### What if they say NO?

It’s great to obtain the consent. But what if some people say NO?

If your respondent’s answer NO, yet they keep filling out the questionnaire; OR IF they say NO but have already answered some questions containing sensitive personal data, before answering this question (in case you didn’t put it right in the beginning) you must manually remove their data which is collected. Deleting data is your own responsibility and is done either using our [deleting individual respondents](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/deleting-individual-responses/) feature, or you do it in your [exported data](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/exporting-survey-data/) and then [delete the entire survey](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/deleting-surveys/) from your account.

Note:

If you keep data on different locations for example by using our APIs  to pull the data into your servers, or by exporting the data locally or to your Google Drive, you must remember that you may have several copies of the same data. Therefore, deleting responses from people who do not give you their consent only only from one of those places that you keep the data is not enough. Make sure  to delete every instance of the data.

Also, when your data retention period is over, you are expected to delete the collected data.

However, a better solution is to stop collecting their personal data as they fill out the questionnaire. Because rest of the answers which do not include any personal data may still be interesting for you as a researcher. So why not keeping that part and just throwing away the personal data part?

To do so, you can easily use [logic flows](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/survey-logic/). Basically, what you need to do is to make one logic flow like this:

IF their answer is (No), THEN hide those questions that collect personal data.

Logic Flow #1IF![survey logic, if answer to the following question](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/logic-i-participants-answer.svg)answer to the following question

\* Is it OK for you, if we _(in accordance with our privacy policy as explained in the beginning)_ use your personal data such as your political opinion and ethnic background which you provide in the 2 questions below?

* ![logic rule icon for choice based questions (for any chosen choices)](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/logic-i-is.svg)is

* No

Read more about [adding logic to Single Selection questions](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/logic-conditions-for-questions-with-choice-input/), and about the [Hide logic](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/hide-logic/).

This way, those questions will be displayed by default (for clarity place them right after this conditional question). But if the respondents select “No”, the questions will be hidden. And even if they have answered them before choosing “No”, that data will automatically be deleted from our servers. Therefore, you will never collect such data in your analytics. But you can still take advantage of the rest of collected data.

Also, you can place this question anywhere in your survey and it doesn’t have to be the first thing that respondents see.

## Sharing collected data in a GDPR-friendly way

With SurveyLegend, you can [export collected survey data](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/exporting-survey-data/) in different formats, and share it with 3rd parties (externally, not within our system).

However, the risk is that you may unintentionally expose personal or sensitive data in this way, because everything will be included in your exported data.

However, we offer a better way of sharing data in real-time!!, which does not expose any personally identifiable information to the viewers.

You can do so, simply by activating a [public link to share your real time data](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/share-survey-results-publicly-using-a-link/), by going to the [![Real-time survey results](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/dashboard-live-analytic.svg) Live Analytics](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/live-analytics/) view, and clicking on the ![share data icon GDPR friendly](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/dashboard-transfer.svg) Share data menu.

![Clicking on the Share Data button gives you options of sharing your surveys privately or publicly.](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/tutorials/Publicly-Export-Share-Survey-Results-Menu.png)

&#x20;

Our system automatically filters away all text-based questions and answers (which are normally the ones that contain personally identifiable data) and shows other questions and graphs to your visitors. They cannot see individual respondents or download the data. Additionally, no other info about individual respondent’s devices, or cities or countries is shown to them.

## In case of data breach

What happens if you figure out that there has been some data breach and your collected personal data has been exposed to third parties?

### Reporting to the authorities

Reporting is only required for breaches which will result in:

“risk to people’s rights or freedoms”

“discrimination, damage to reputation, financial loss, loss of confidentiality or any other significant economic or social disadvantage.”

In [Article 33](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG#d1e3434-1-1) they mention that if your respondents’ personal information is exposed in a way that results in risking or damaging them, you (the data controller) not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, must notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance.

### Reporting to your respondents

If you identify that there is a “high risk to their rights and freedoms”, then you must notify your respondents too.

For most types of feedback forms, it’s quite difficult to consider the data-breach as high-risk. Unless you’re processing sensitive data, for example if your business is in the health sector.

## Will I have to pay a 20 million Euros fine if something happens?

Almost certainly not! This €20,000,000 has been a hot headline but this is for the absolute worst cases. There is also a lower fine of 10 million Euros which is also for standard offences.

According to [ICO’s news blog](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-gdpr-sorting-the-fact-from-the-fiction/), fines are the last resort. The law is there to help (or sort of force) businesses to do the right thing and correct their structure. It’s to protect people. It is not about giving fines to small businesses here and there.

Fines are for the bad guys with bad intentions! You’re not one of them. You’re a legend, already finishing this article, because you want to do the right thing.

## But our organization has nothing to do with EU citizens

Many people wonder about this. Our company is not located in the EU. We’re not dealing with citizens of Europian Union? Should we still care about GDPR?

Well, the short answer is: “usually not, but it depends”. However, the right answer is, “Of course you should!”.

Unlike the old law of Data Protection Directive, the GDPR can apply to any globally operating company. It is not made just for those located in the EU.

Under the GDPR, organizations may be in scope if:

* the organization is established in the EU, or
* the organization is not established in the EU but the data processing activities are with regard to EU individuals and relate to the offering of goods and services to them or the monitoring of their behavior.

Even if your company is not established here, we recommend you to take the law very seriosuly and reform how you handle personal data in your organization.

The GDPR is about having a healthy digital culture in the company. It is about respecting privacy of individuals. It is not about EU citizens.

It’s true that the initiative has taken place in EU to protect their own citizens. But first of all, how do you know when your own company will enforce similar laws? Isn’t it better to be ready for it already? Secondly, why not practicing a better version of treatment for personal information of people who trust you and give it to you? There is noting wrong with that 🙂

And you never know, maybe someone from EU answers your surveys and then…. things go ?

If for some reason you must treat citizens of other regions differently in your surveys when it comes to personal data collection, then use our [survey logics](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/survey-logic/), ask if they are from EU, and if the answer is NO, do show or hide those questions that you must.
