# Where is data stored?

## Introduction

Like many digital services companies we use a 3rd party service provided by google called [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).   Firebase is an app development platform that helps us build and grow our apps. It is backed by Google and trusted by millions of businesses around the world.

The Service uses the following products from Firebase for its core functionalities:

* [**Real-time database**](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database).
* [**Hosting**](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting)
* [**Authentication**](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)
* [**Cloud Firestore**](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
* [**Cloud Functions**](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions)
* [**Cloud Storage**](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage)

Furthermore, the Service uses the following Firebase products to monitor the app and improve its quality:

* [**Performance monitoring**](https://firebase.google.com/products/performance)
* [**Analytics**](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics)

## Where are Firebases servers located?

A few Firebase services are only run from US data centers. As a result, these services process data exclusively in the United States:

* Firebase Realtime Database
* Firebase Hosting
* Firebase Authentication

The other Firebase services run on global Google infrastructure. They could process data at any of the [Google Cloud Platform locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/) or [Google data center locations](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/index.html).

### Does GDPR require EU personal data to stay in the EU?

No, the GDPR does not require EU personal data to stay in the EU. &#x20;

The general principle for transfers of data outside the EU is outlined in [Article 44 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-44-gdpr/).  This can be summarised as saying, if you transfer EU personal data out of the EU, you must ensure that this data still enjoys the same level of protection it gets under GDPR.  In other words, the entity or company that you pass the data to outside the EU must be under a legally binding obligation to follow GDPR data protection principles or the equivalent.

## Does Firebase have a legally binding obligation to follow GDPR data protection principles or the equivalent?

The Privacy Shield frameworks provided a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring EEA, UK or Swiss personal data to the United States and onwards.&#x20;

In light of the Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on data transfers, invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Firebase has moved to reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses for relevant data transfers, which, as per the ruling, can continue to be a valid legal mechanism to transfer data under the GDPR. The European Commission approved[ new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses on June 4, 2021.](https://cloud.google.com/terms/eu-model-contract-clause)

Firebase are committed to having a lawful basis for data transfers in compliance with applicable data protection laws.&#x20;
