# Why and how do we collect data?

## Introduction

We are a digital company offering online survey solutions.  Therefore our core business is built around collecting data, keeping it safe and putting it to work.   We treat your data and your repondents data with great care.

You can read our [Privacy Policy](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms) to get a detailed understanding on how we treat issues of data privacy and security.  Our Privacy Policy explains in detail why and how we collect data from our Users, Respondents, and Visitors, how we use it, and how long we keep it.&#x20;

In this page, we provide pretty much the same information mentioned above, but written in a shorter and easier-to-understand way and focused on data we collect from our Users.

## Information that our users manually give us:

### 1. Through account registration

To use SurveyLegend’s solution, you must create an account. Personal data and other user’ information collected by SurveyLegend is used in order to complete user registration and at the same time to ensure access to SurveyLegend’s services and products. To register an account, you have two choices.

* Either use our registration form and enter a custom “user name”, “your email address”, and a personal “password”.
* Or use available 3rd parties such as Google, Facebook, or Linkedin to register and authenticate yourself.

&#x20; In any case, this is the personal information about you which we naturally **save** in our system:

* Your **username** (only visible to admins of SurveyLegend’s website)
* Your **real name** or **nickname** that you have specified in the 3rd party providers (only if you use the 3rd party providers to create the account, and only visible to admins of SurveyLegend’s website)
* Your **email address** (only visible to admins of SurveyLegend’s website)
* Your **password** (will be encrypted and therefore not visible or accessible to admins or other employees)

&#x20; Just like any other online tool, we need to save these data to be able to authenticate you when you login. Also, your email address will be used according to our [Terms and Privacy Policies](https://www.surveylegend.com/terms-and-privacy/), for different purposes. For example, to enable you to reset your forgotten password, or send you [email notifications](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/notifications/) about your surveys’ performance and newly collected responses. Your email address will never be shared with 3rd parties.   &#x20;
