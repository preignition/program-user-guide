# Why and how do we collect data?

## Introduction

We are a digital services company offering online survey solutions.  Therefore our core business is built around collecting data, keeping it safe and putting it to work.   We treat your data and your Respondent's data with great care.

You can read our [Privacy Policy](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms) to get a detailed understanding on how we handle data privacy and security issues.  Our Privacy Policy explains in detail why and how we collect data from our Users, Respondents, and Visitors, how we use it, and how long we keep it.&#x20;

In this page, we provide the same information as covered in our Privacy Policy, but written in a shorter and easier-to-understand way and focusing on data we collect from our Users.

## Information that our Users actively give us:

### 1. When you create an account

To use our platform as a User, you must create an account.  Personal data and other user information collected when you create an account is used in order to complete user registration and at the same time to ensure users can access our services and products. To register an account, you have two choices.

* Either use our registration form and enter “your email address”, and a personal “password” and your "first name"
* Or use available Third Parties such as Google or Facebook to register and authenticate yourself.

&#x20; In any case, this is the personal information about you which we save in our system:

* Your **email address** (only visible to admins of Preignition’s website)
* Your **first name** (only visible to admins of Preignition's website)
* Your **password** (will be encrypted and therefore not visible or accessible to admins or other employees)

Like other online platfoms, we need to save this data to be able to authenticate you when you login.  Also, your email address will be used according to our [Terms and Privacy Policies](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms), for various purposes.  For example, to enable you to reset your password, or send you email notifications about your surveys’ performance or newly collected responses. &#x20;

We will never share your email address with 3rd parties.   &#x20;

### 2. When you create surveys and collect responses

When you create forms and surveys, you naturally type questions or upload pictures to be used in questions or answer choices.   Also, when you send out your surveys to your Respondents, they will manually enter information or upload files while answering your questions.&#x20;

The data that you as a User, or your Respondents manually enter to our system will be securely saved on our data centers hosted by a Google service called [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4aacBhCUARIsAI55maGov1EP4dvqYPlCSDmIEVz7okIywyqczYRsSr8qqW4nPNbeTZrP8roaArYvEALw\_wcB\&gclsrc=aw.ds).   Firebase complies with GDPR and data is processed and stored on [Google Cloud servers that abide by the European Union (EU) data protection directive](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/eu-data-protection/).

## Data that we automatically collect about you <a href="#data-that-we-automatically-collect-about-you" id="data-that-we-automatically-collect-about-you"></a>

Just like all other companies which provide digital services, we need to know how people use our website or app. This is achieved through using data analytics and tracking software in our website and app. These terms may sound scary, but we can assure you that we don’t do anything sinister or underhand with this data.

### 1.  **Through Google Analytics for Firebase**

Both on our website and in our app, we use a service from Google which is called [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics).  Google Analytics for Firebase is used for tracking page views and user behaviour within our Services. We may collect device information such as device type, operating system and browser version. Data is kept in Google’s systems and is used to provide an overview of a large group of users. It is not used to track individual users.&#x20;

Google Analytics for Firebase shows us general information which is not personally identifiable. For example, we cannot see exactly who has searched for a specific keyword on Google to find our website, or we can never know the precise location of our Users or Visitors. We are only able to see general behavior such as which countries they are from, which pages on our website are most visited, what devices (computers, tables, or smartphones) or web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc..) are used to access our site or app, and things like that.  Another thing we can notice is generic browsing patterns, for instance users who come to page A, usually go to page B, and then from there go to page C, and then X% of them will create an account.

Our data in Firebase for Google Analytics is stored there as long as we have our Google Analytics account. Keep in mind that we do not have any personal data there!

### 2. Through Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data generated by a website and saved by your web browser. Its purpose is to remember information about you, similar to a preference file created by a software application. While cookies serve many functions, their most common purpose is to store login information for a specific site.

Our Service uses a single Cookie as part of the account authentication process. &#x20;
