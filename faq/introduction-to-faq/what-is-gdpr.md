# What is GDPR?

## What is the GDPR?

The [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_Data\_Protection\_Regulation) (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new comprehensive data protection law (in effect May 25, 2018) in the European Union that aims to improve the protection of personal data.&#x20;

We are living in an era of rapid technological developments, expanding globalization, and more complex international flows of personal data, specially in the digital world. GDPR tries to update and replace the mixture of the current national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state. &#x20;

### What does the GDPR regulate?

The GDPR regulates the “processing” of personal data for citizens of EU countries. This includes collection, storage, transfer, or use of data. Any organization that processes personal data of EU individuals is within the scope of the law.&#x20;

Preignition Limited is located in the UK which is no longer a member of the EU.  However, according to this law, it does not matter whether the organization has a physical presence in the EU or not.&#x20;

GDPR defines the notion of “personal data” very broadly, which covers any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (also called a “data subject”). &#x20;

### How does GDPR change privacy law?

The key changes are the following: Expanded data privacy rights for EU individuals, data breach notification and added security requirements for organizations, as well as customer profiling and monitoring requirements.&#x20;

GDPR also includes binding Corporate Rules for organizations to legalize transfers of personal data outside the EU, and a 4% global revenue fine for organizations that fail to adhere to the GDPR compliance obligations.&#x20;

Overall the GDPR provides a central point of enforcement by requiring companies to work with a lead supervisory authority for cross-border data protection issues. &#x20;

### Key Definitions under GDPR

The GDPR applies to data 'controllers’ and data 'processors’.

**Controller-**  Controllers are the main decision-makers – they exercise overall control over the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.  Processors act on behalf of, and only on the instructions of, the relevant controller.  If you use our service to create surveys and collect data from Respondents, you will be the controller for this data.

**Processor-**  Processors are responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.  GDPR places specific legal obligations on processors; for example, they are required to maintain records of personal data and processing activities and have legal liability if they are responsible for a breach.

### Principles underpinning GDPR

#### What are the principles?&#x20;

Article 5 of the GDPR sets out seven key principles which lie at the heart of the general data protection regime.

Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be: ****&#x20;

> “(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);
>
> (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
>
> (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
>
> (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
>
> (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);
>
> (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).”

Article 5(2) adds that:

> “The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).”

More detail on each principle is provided in the [regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-2/).

### Why are the principles important? <a href="#why_are_the_principles_important" id="why_are_the_principles_important"></a>

The principles lie at the heart of the GDPR. They are set out right at the start of the legislation, and inform everything that follows. They don’t give hard and fast rules, but rather embody the spirit of the general data protection regime - and as such there are very limited exceptions.

Compliance with the spirit of these key principles is therefore a fundamental building block for good data protection practice. It is also key to your compliance with the detailed provisions of the GDPR.

### Who are data controllers and what are their responsibilities



#### What are your responsibilities as a controller? <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

If you are a controller, you are responsible for ensuring your processing – including any processing carried out by a processor on your behalf – complies with the UK GDPR. Your UK GDPR responsibilities include the following:

* **Compliance with the data protection principles**: you must comply with the data protection principles listed in Article 5 of the UK GDPR. For more information please read our guidance on the [principles](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/).
* **Individuals’ rights**: you must ensure that individuals can exercise their rights regarding their personal data, including the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, objection and those related to automated decision-making. For more information please read our guidance on [individuals’ rights](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/).
* **Security**: you must implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to ensure the security of personal data. For more information please read our guidance on [security](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/).
* **Choosing an appropriate processor**: you can only use a processor that provides sufficient guarantees that they will implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure their processing meets UK GDPR requirements. This means you are responsible for assessing that your processor is competent to process the personal data in line with the UK GDPR’s requirements. This assessment should take into account the nature of the processing and the risks to the data subjects.
* **Processor contracts**: you must enter into a binding contract or other legal act with your processors, which must contain a number of compulsory provisions as specified in Article 28(3). For more information please read our guidance on [contracts](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/contracts/).
* **Notification of personal data breaches**: you are responsible for notifying personal data breaches to the ICO and, where necessary, other supervisory authorities in the EU, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. You are also responsible for notifying affected individuals (if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms). For more information please read our guidance on [personal data breaches.](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/)
* **Accountability obligations**: you must comply with the UK GDPR accountability obligations, such as maintaining records, carrying out data protection impact assessments and appointing a data protection officer. For more information please read our guidance on [accountability and governance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/).
* **International transfers**: you must comply with the UK GDPR’s restrictions on transfers of personal data outside of the UK. For more information please read our guidance on [international transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/).
* **Co-operation with supervisory authorities**: you must cooperate with supervisory authorities (such as the ICO) and help them perform their duties.
* **Data protection fee**: you must pay the ICO a data protection fee unless you are exempt. For more information please see our guidance on [the data protection fee](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-fee/).

### Who are data processors and what are their responsibilities?



#### What are your responsibilities as a processor? <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

Processors have less autonomy and independence over the data they process, but they do have several direct legal obligations under the UK GDPR and are subject to regulation by supervisory authorities. If you are a processor, you have the following obligations.

* **Controller’s instructions**: you can only process the personal data on instructions from a controller (unless otherwise required by law). If you act outside your instructions or process for your own purposes, you will step outside your role as a processor and become a controller for that processing.
* **Processor contracts**: you must enter into a binding contract with the controller. This must contain a number of compulsory provisions, and you must comply with your obligations as a processor under the contract. For more information please read our guidance on [contracts](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/contracts/).
* **Sub-processors**: you must not engage another processor (ie a sub-processor) without the controller’s prior specific or general written authorisation. If authorisation is given, you must put in place a contract with the sub-processor with terms that offer an equivalent level of protection for the personal data as those in the contract between you and the controller.
* **Security**: you must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of personal data, including protecting against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. For more information please read our guidance on [security](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/).
* **Notification of personal data breaches**: if you become aware of a personal data breach, you must notify the relevant controller without undue delay. Most controllers will expect to be notified immediately, and may contractually require this, as they only have a limited time in which to notify the supervisory authority (such as the ICO). You must also assist the controller in complying with its obligations regarding personal data breaches. For more information please read our guidance on [personal data breaches](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/).
* **Notification of potential data protection infringements**: you must notify the controller immediately if any of their instructions would lead to a breach of the UK GDPR or local data protection laws.
* **Accountability obligations**: you must comply with certain UK GDPR accountability obligations, such as maintaining records and appointing a data protection officer. For more information please read our guidance on [accountability and governance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/).
* **International transfers**: the UK GDPR's prohibition on transferring personal data applies equally to processors as it does to controllers. This means you must ensure that any transfer outside the UK is authorised by the controller and complies with the UK GDPR’s transfer provisions. For more information please read our guidance on [international transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/).
* **Co-operation with supervisory authorities:** you are also obliged to cooperate with supervisory authorities (such as the ICO) to help them perform their duties. &#x20;
