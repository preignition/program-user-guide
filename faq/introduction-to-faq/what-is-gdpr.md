# What is GDPR?

## What is the GDPR?

The [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_Data\_Protection\_Regulation) (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new comprehensive data protection law (in effect May 25, 2018) in the European Union that aims to improve the protection of personal data.&#x20;

We are living in an era of rapid technological developments, expanding globalization, and more complex international flows of personal data, specially in the digital world. GDPR tries to update and replace the mixture of the current national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state. &#x20;

### What does the GDPR regulate?

The GDPR regulates the “processing” of personal data for citizens of EU countries. This includes collection, storage, transfer, or use of data. Any organization that processes personal data of EU individuals is within the scope of the law.&#x20;

Preignition Limited is located in the UK which is no longer a member of the EU.  However, according to this law, it does not matter whether the organization has a physical presence in the EU or not.&#x20;

GDPR defines the notion of “personal data” very broadly, which covers any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (also called a “data subject”). &#x20;

### How does GDPR change privacy law?

The key changes are the following: Expanded data privacy rights for EU individuals, data breach notification and added security requirements for organizations, as well as customer profiling and monitoring requirements.&#x20;

GDPR also includes binding Corporate Rules for organizations to legalize transfers of personal data outside the EU, and a 4% global revenue fine for organizations that fail to adhere to the GDPR compliance obligations.&#x20;

Overall the GDPR provides a central point of enforcement by requiring companies to work with a lead supervisory authority for cross-border data protection issues. &#x20;

### Key Definitions under GDPR

The GDPR applies to data 'controllers’ and data 'processors’.

**Controller-**  Controllers are the main decision-makers – they exercise overall control over the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.  Processors act on behalf of, and only on the instructions of, the relevant controller.  If you use our service to create surveys and collect data from Respondents, you will be the controller for this data.

**Processor-**  Processors are responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.  GDPR places specific legal obligations on processors; for example, they are required to maintain records of personal data and processing activities and have legal liability if they are responsible for a breach.

### Principles underpinning GDPR

#### What are the principles?&#x20;

Article 5 of the GDPR sets out seven key principles which lie at the heart of the general data protection regime.

Article 5(1) requires that personal data shall be: ****&#x20;

> “(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);
>
> (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
>
> (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);
>
> (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
>
> (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals (‘storage limitation’);
>
> (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).”

Article 5(2) adds that:

> “The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).”

More detail on each principle is provided in the [regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-2/).

### Why are the principles important? <a href="#why_are_the_principles_important" id="why_are_the_principles_important"></a>

The principles lie at the heart of the GDPR. They are set out right at the start of the legislation, and inform everything that follows. They don’t give hard and fast rules, but rather embody the spirit of the general data protection regime - and as such there are very limited exceptions.

Compliance with the spirit of these key principles is therefore a fundamental building block for good data protection practice. It is also key to your compliance with the detailed provisions of the GDPR.
