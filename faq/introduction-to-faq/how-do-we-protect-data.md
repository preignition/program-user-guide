# How do we protect data?

## Introduction

The security and privacy of our Users, Respondents and Visitor's data is of paramount importance to us. &#x20;

We use some of latest technologies for internet security that are available today to help us keep your data safe.  In addition we gather only as much personal data as is needed to provide our Services in a secure, efficient and effective way. &#x20;

We comply with the GDPR regulations, which aim to protect personal and sensitive information.

### Data Processing and Security Terms <a href="#data-processing-and-security-terms" id="data-processing-and-security-terms"></a>

When customers use our Services, Preignition is generally a data processor under GDPR and processes personal data on behalf of our Users.

#### Google grade security level <a href="#google-grade-security-level" id="google-grade-security-level"></a>

Our system uses a 3rd party service made by Google called [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). In the context of GDPR, Google acts as a data processor for Preignition.&#x20;

The Service uses the following products from Firebase for its core functionalities. They provide the service and its users with high-level security standards across the entire application stack, including authentication, data storage and transmission.

* [**Real-time database**](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database).
* [**Hosting**](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting)
* [**Authentication**](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)
* [**Cloud Firestore**](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
* [**Cloud Functions**](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions)
* [**Cloud Storage**](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage)

#### Data encryption <a href="#data-encryption" id="data-encryption"></a>

Firebase services encrypt data in transit using HTTPS and logically isolate customer data.

In addition, the Firebase services Preignition uses for storage also encrypt their data at rest.

#### Security Rules and Authentication <a href="#security-rules-and-authentication" id="security-rules-and-authentication"></a>

We use Firebase authentication and security rules to ensure granular control of who has read, write or update access to what in the application.

We allow email and password based authentication, as well as federated identity providers authentication such as Gmail or Facebook. In some cases, we also allow anonymous authentication without requiring users to sign in first by creating temporary anonymous accounts.

### Your Responsibilities <a href="#your-responsibilities" id="your-responsibilities"></a>

Our Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their account by using suitably complicated passwords and storing them safely.   Users should also make sure that they have enough security on their own systems; to keep any survey data that they download to their own computer secure.
