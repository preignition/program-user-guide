# How can I ensure that my surveys GDPR compliant?

## Introduction

This page provides some practical instructutions our Users, to help them apply GDPR principles to ensure that their surveys are GDPR compliant.

## Make sure that your survey provider is GDPR compliant&#x20;

[Article 28](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG\&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC#d1e3150-1-1) of GDPR states that:

> The controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.

It is therefore your responsibility to make sure that your data processors operate in a GDPR-compliant way. &#x20;

So if you have a Data Protection Officer, ask them to check your supplier‚Äôs (processors‚Äô) privacy and security policies to ensure that they adhere to the GDPR (here are our [terms and privacy policy](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms))

## Make sure you have a lawful basis for processing your respondent's data

The first Principle of GDPR is that personal data must be 'processed lawfully'. &#x20;

We understand this to mean that the following is in place:

1. **Consent.**  When collecting personal data your respondents must deliberately and willfully tell you that it is OK that you collect data about them, for the purposes that you clearly explain to them.&#x20;
2. **Legitimate interest.**  When collecting personal data you (your organization or company) should be able to convincingly prove that collecting personal data is in your **** legitimate interest.  ie that it‚Äôs in your (and your customers‚Äô) interests to collect feedback, data and their personal info.  For example to solve their problems, or enhance your services.

## Don't cut corners when getting consent

Consent basically means getting permissions for something you want to do.  Consent must be ‚Äú_unambiguous_‚Äù, and in the case of sensitive data, ‚Äú_explicit_‚Äù.&#x20;

This means you cannot use tactics like pre-ticked checkboxes, or trick people somehow to agree with something that they don‚Äôt really understand or haven't properly read.

The new law says:

> When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them

Also, your request for consent must be clear, brief and not disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided.

If you genuinely feel that your research and use of data has a legitimate interest and is respectful of your Respondents, then don‚Äôt feel that you need to obtain consent. Just make sure you‚Äôre completely transparent about ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you‚Äôre planing to use data in your survey process. Also give people the chance contact you for further info or to opt-out. Otherwise, you must obtain consent.

See the FAQ '[How to write a GDPR-proof Privacy Policy for your Surveys](how-to-write-gdpr-proof-privacy-policy-for-your-surveys.md)' for more guidance about how to put this into practice.

## Make it easy for Respondents to refuse consent

It‚Äôs great to obtain the consent. But what if some people say 'no'?

You must make it as easy for respondents to refuse consent as it is for them to provide consent.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is a good idea to ask for consent at the beginning of your survey and before Respondents have provided any personal data. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;&#x20;

If your respondent‚Äôs refuse consent but have either already answered some questions containing personal data, or provide personal data anyway, it is your responsibility to manually remove any of their personal data which is collected.   We can help you do this but it can be time consuming and so is best avoided.

## Make sure you share collected data in a GDPR-friendly way

With our service, you can export collected survey data in different formats, and share it with 3rd parties (externally, not within our system).

However, the risk is that you may unintentionally expose personal or sensitive data in this way, because everything will be included in your exported data.

However, we offer a better way of sharing data in real-time!!, which does not expose any personally identifiable information to the viewers.

You can do so, simply by activating a [public link to share your real time data](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/share-survey-results-publicly-using-a-link/), by going to the [![Real-time survey results](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/dashboard-live-analytic.svg) Live Analytics](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/live-analytics/) view, and clicking on the ![share data icon GDPR friendly](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/img/icons/dashboard-transfer.svg) Share data menu.

![Clicking on the Share Data button gives you options of sharing your surveys privately or publicly.](https://www.surveylegend.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/sage/resources/images/tutorials/Publicly-Export-Share-Survey-Results-Menu.png)

&#x20;

Our system automatically filters away all text-based questions and answers (which are normally the ones that contain personally identifiable data) and shows other questions and graphs to your visitors. They cannot see individual respondents or download the data. Additionally, no other info about individual respondent‚Äôs devices, or cities or countries is shown to them.

## In case of data breach

What happens if you figure out that there has been some data breach and your collected personal data has been exposed to third parties?

### Reporting to the authorities

Reporting is only required for breaches which will result in:

‚Äúrisk to people‚Äôs rights or freedoms‚Äù

‚Äúdiscrimination, damage to reputation, financial loss, loss of confidentiality or any other significant economic or social disadvantage.‚Äù

In [Article 33](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG#d1e3434-1-1) they mention that if your respondents‚Äô personal information is exposed in a way that results in risking or damaging them, you (the data controller) not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, must notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance.

### Reporting to your respondents

If you identify that there is a ‚Äúhigh risk to their rights and freedoms‚Äù, then you must notify your respondents too.

For most types of feedback forms, it‚Äôs quite difficult to consider the data-breach as high-risk. Unless you‚Äôre processing sensitive data, for example if your business is in the health sector.

## Will I have to pay a 20 million Euros fine if something happens?

Almost certainly not! This ‚Ç¨20,000,000 has been a hot headline but this is for the absolute worst cases. There is also a lower fine of 10 million Euros which is also for standard offences.

According to [ICO‚Äôs news blog](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-gdpr-sorting-the-fact-from-the-fiction/), fines are the last resort. The law is there to help (or sort of force) businesses to do the right thing and correct their structure. It‚Äôs to protect people. It is not about giving fines to small businesses here and there.

Fines are for the bad guys with bad intentions! You‚Äôre not one of them. You‚Äôre a legend, already finishing this article, because you want to do the right thing.

## But our organization has nothing to do with EU citizens

Many people wonder about this. Our company is not located in the EU. We‚Äôre not dealing with citizens of Europian Union? Should we still care about GDPR?

Well, the short answer is: ‚Äúusually not, but it depends‚Äù. However, the right answer is, ‚ÄúOf course you should!‚Äù.

Unlike the old law of Data Protection Directive, the GDPR can apply to any globally operating company. It is not made just for those located in the EU.

Under the GDPR, organizations may be in scope if:

* the organization is established in the EU, or
* the organization is not established in the EU but the data processing activities are with regard to EU individuals and relate to the offering of goods and services to them or the monitoring of their behavior.

Even if your company is not established here, we recommend you to take the law very seriosuly and reform how you handle personal data in your organization.

The GDPR is about having a healthy digital culture in the company. It is about respecting privacy of individuals. It is not about EU citizens.

It‚Äôs true that the initiative has taken place in EU to protect their own citizens. But first of all, how do you know when your own company will enforce similar laws? Isn‚Äôt it better to be ready for it already? Secondly, why not practicing a better version of treatment for personal information of people who trust you and give it to you? There is noting wrong with that üôÇ

And you never know, maybe someone from EU answers your surveys and then‚Ä¶. things go ?

If for some reason you must treat citizens of other regions differently in your surveys when it comes to personal data collection, then use our [survey logics](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/survey-logic/), ask if they are from EU, and if the answer is NO, do show or hide those questions that you must.
