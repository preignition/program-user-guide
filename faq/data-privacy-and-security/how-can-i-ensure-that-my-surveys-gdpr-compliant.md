# How can I ensure that my surveys GDPR compliant?

## Introduction

This page provides some practical instructutions our Users, to help them apply GDPR principles to ensure that their surveys are GDPR compliant.

## Make sure that your survey provider is GDPR compliant&#x20;

[Article 28](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG\&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC#d1e3150-1-1) of GDPR states that:

> The controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.

It is therefore your responsibility to make sure that your data processors operate in a GDPR-compliant way. &#x20;

So if you have a Data Protection Officer, ask them to check your supplier’s (processors’) privacy and security policies to ensure that they adhere to the GDPR (here are our [terms and privacy policy](https://accessiblesurveys.com/home/terms))

## Make sure you have a lawful basis for processing your respondent's data

The first Principle of GDPR is that personal data must be 'processed lawfully'. &#x20;

We understand this to mean that either of the following is in place:

1. **Consent.**  When collecting personal data your respondents must deliberately and willfully tell you that it is OK that you collect data about them, for the purposes that you clearly explain to them.&#x20;
2. **Legitimate interest.**  When collecting personal data you (your organization or company) should be able to convincingly prove that collecting personal data is in your **** legitimate interest.  ie that it’s in your (and your customers’) interests to collect feedback, data and their personal info.  For example to solve their problems, or enhance your services.

If you genuinely feel that your research and use of data has a legitimate interest and is respectful of your Respondents, then don’t feel that you need to obtain consent. Just make sure you’re completely transparent about “how” and “why” you’re planing to use data in your survey process. Also give people the chance contact you for further info or to opt-out. Otherwise, you must obtain consent.

## Don't cut corners when getting consent

Consent basically means getting permissions for something you want to do.  Consent must be “_unambiguous_”, and in the case of sensitive data, “_explicit_”.&#x20;

This means you cannot use tactics like pre-ticked checkboxes, or trick people somehow to agree with something that they don’t really understand or haven't properly read.

### For collecting non-sensitive data:

According to the GDPR, for non-sensitive data, you need “unambiguous, affirmative” consent, not “explicit” consent. Therefore, you can rely on a completely unmistakable notice at the start of your survey.

for example:

> By filling out this survey you agree that we will process your data in line with our our privacy policy

A good place to have this information in your questionnaires is the Landing Page. This feature allows you to add a starting page for your surveys or forms, which can only include data, pictures, and a button to START the survey.



&#x20;

The image above shows an example of a getting consent for non-sensitive data in a survey, using a landing page.

You provide clear information and put a note for getting consent. Note that this is just a simple example. The amount of information that you provide here and how you describe it is up to you and your research case.

Remember that you must explain personal data processed, purpose of processing, intended retention, subject rights, source of data, conditions of processing. Of course it can become a heavy start for a survey and you don’t want to scare people. So, it’s good to keep it short and add a link to your privacy policy page, or a page that fully describes your research process.

### For collecting sensitive data:

According to the GDPR, to collect sensitive data, you need “explicit” consent.

As we already mentioned, individuals must understand clearly and unambiguously what they are giving permission to. Therefore,you must simply articulate your request and be specific.

What is important here is that, consent should be given in the form of a clear affirmative action on the part of the data subject. In practical terms, this means asking for a positive “opt-in”. It also means that pre-ticked boxes should not be used, before they start the survey.

So, after explaining your privacy policy and how / why of your research, you can start the survey by asking a first question like this one:

Note:

Use a [Single Selection](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/single-selection/) question (NOT a Multiple Selection question).

Make this question compulsory by enabling the [Answer is required](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/demand-required-answer/) setting!

\* Is it OK for you, if we use your personal data such as your health status which you provide when filling out this questionnaire (in accordance with our privacy policy as explained in the beginning)?

* Yes
* No

Here you see that you are providing a clear “opt-in” possibility. Respondents must give you permission to use their data, since answering is required.

&#x20;

Tip:

Perhaps you want to collect several pieces of sensitive data about your respondents. Therefore, it might easily become too much and too intimidating to describe why you need to collect each of them at the beginning of the survey.

So, do we have a nicer solution for this? Oh yes!

What you can do is to simply describe the way data will be used right under the question itself. SurveyLegend has a little nifty feature called [Instructions For Respondents](https://www.surveylegend.com/user-guide/instructions-for-respondents/). Enabling this will add a piece of text with a smaller font size underneath the question text, where you can explain why you need the data.

Also, make sure to turn on the “Always visible instructions” setting, so that your respondents won’t miss your explanation. Here is an example of how it could look like:

What is your full name?

We need this to be able to verify your membership at our institute.

What is your email address?

We need your email to be able to send you information about your results of this survey.

What is your ethnic origin?

This information helps our organization to have better marketing campaigns and external communications, reaching the right audience.

This way, you are not only more transparent and more clear about your use of their data (which is in accordance with GDPR regulation), but also, it is easier for a human brain to process the information. It will be less scary and less intimidating to answer your questions.

## Make it easy for Respondents to refuse consent

It’s great to obtain the consent. But what if some people say 'no'?

You must make it as easy for respondents to refuse consent as it is for them to provide consent.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is a good idea to ask for consent at the beginning of your survey and before Respondents have provided any personal data. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;&#x20;

If your respondent’s refuse consent but have either already answered some questions containing personal data, or provide personal data anyway, it is your responsibility to manually remove any of their personal data which is collected.   We can help you do this but it can be time consuming and so is best avoided.

## Have a GDPR-proof Privacy Policy for your Surveys

##

## Make sure you share collected data in a GDPR-friendly way

With our service, you can export collected survey data in different formats, and share it with 3rd parties (externally, not within our system).

You will be reminded of your data protection responsbilities before downloading any data.  You will also have the option of downloading an 'anonmyized' dataset. &#x20;

An 'anonmyized' dataset won't include any metadata or data response feild that have been marked as 'private' by the person who created the survey.

If you do export a 'raw' or 'humanized' version of your survey results it is your responsibility for keeping the data safe and treating it in line with GDPR.&#x20;

## Make sure you take appropriate action in case of a data breach

What happens if you figure out that there has been some data breach and your collected personal data has been exposed to third parties?

### Reporting to the authorities

Reporting is only required for breaches which will result in:

“risk to people’s rights or freedoms”

“discrimination, damage to reputation, financial loss, loss of confidentiality or any other significant economic or social disadvantage.”

In [Article 33](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L\_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG#d1e3434-1-1) they mention that if your respondents’ personal information is exposed in a way that results in risking or damaging them, you (the data controller) not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, must notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance.

### Reporting to your respondents

If you identify that there is a “high risk to their rights and freedoms”, then you must notify your respondents too.

For most types of feedback forms, it’s quite difficult to consider the data-breach as high-risk. Unless you’re processing sensitive data, for example if your business is in the health sector.
