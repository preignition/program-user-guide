## Summary

Surveys in sign language(s) are important to allow deaf people to respond in their language.  Deaf people report it makes a big difference for them to access a survey withsigned videos.&#x20;

When preparing a survey in sign language, make sure that you:

* Select the right online survey tool
* Ensure the quality of signed videos, with recording by a professional interpreter
* Record separate videos for each question
* Ask the recording studio to have another signer to test the recording to make sure it is clear

## Why make a survey available in Sign Language?

> "I understood the questions, and it gave me confidence in answering. Sometimes if it’s in English, I’m not always sure. Whereas with ASL (American Sign Language) based multiple choice options, I felt very confident and clear with my answers because ASL is my first language."([Worcester Polytechnic Institute, ASL Education Centre](https://users.wpi.edu/\~esolovey/papers/mahajan-chi22.pdf))&#x20;

It is not appropriate to assume that all deaf people can read and respond using written languages.&#x20;

Deaf people consistently report a preference for websites that incorporate signed languages, regardless of their level of fluency with print languages.&#x20;

Some deaf people are bilingual or multilingual signers, with excellent command of one or more signed and written languages (e.g. American Sign Language and English or International Sign). Other deaf people have much stronger fluency in their national sign language. Finally, many deaf people living in the Global South do not have access at all to written language and education, while they may have some comprehension in their national sign language.&#x20;

Survey tools are typically designed for written text, and therefore miss a lot of deaf respondents.

## Choice of sign language(s)

There are over 300 sign languages used in the world, so you should choose the one(s) that are most commonly used by your survey audience. For example, use the national sign language of the country in which you will disseminate your survey.

If you run a global survey, you may want to use International Sign, recording your videos with a signer accredited by the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters (WASLI). You can also decide to use American Sign Language (ASL) or British Sign Language (BSL) which are the most known sign languages. French Sign Language (LSF) and Australian Sign Language (Auslan) are also used a lot in certain regions.

If you want to run your survey in sign language, make sure you choose an appropriate online tool for this.  [Accessible Surveys](http://www.accessiblesurveys.com) allows you to do this.   Questions and answer options can be signed in the sign language you choose.  All data collected through different versions of your survey are collated in one single dataset.

## How to proceed?

### Choose an online survey tool that allows video format&#x20;

* Several online survey tools allow for video upload at the level of the question. Fewer allow you to upload videos linked to questions and also to response options. No tools currently allow you to record a video to answer an open-ended question (Accessible Surveys is exploring with partners the feasibility and interest to develop this feature).&#x20;
* When online survey tools allow the use of videos, signers responding may still face challenges related to the platform design: for example, they may need to navigate multiple videos while adjusting manually window size and placement of videos, or video uploading can take a lot of time and cause frustration.
* Respondents using videos usually prefer clean and simple page designs, limits on the number of videos per page or screen, video length, and speed controls.&#x20;

### Ensure quality of the videos&#x20;

The first thing to do is to connect with a qualified interpreter who has a studio to record signed videos of professional quality. To facilitate the process, make sure that you communicate your requirements clearly in advance. This includes:&#x20;

* Best practices for signed video recording
* Accreditation of the professional interpreter in the relevant sign language(s)
* Clear instructions on recording of videos, including single or multiple clips, captioning
* Quality check for example through back translation
* Timeline to complete the work (linked to the launch date of your survey)

Signers recording the questions and response options in video format should enforce best practices for video production. These include landscape framing, eye contact, proper lighting, a plain background, solid clothing, etc.&#x20;

The signer’s proficiency level in the concerned signed language and knowledge of the deaf culture and community is important to avoid confusion and increase the trust and confidence of the respondent.&#x20;

Record separate videos for each question:

* If the survey platform allows this, record one video including one single question and the related response options in a single video sequence. Response options should be introduced by the interpreter in the exact same order as they appear on the screen. Once recorded, do not shift the order of responses to avoid errors in recording people’s answers.
* Including captions is recommended, following recommended standards for sufficient size and contrast. If you are not a signer, this will help you identify and upload the right videos with the right question on the survey app.&#x20;
* Pay attention to not change the content/ text of your survey questions after you recorded the videos to avoid any discrepancy between the signed and written version.

Testing of videos by a deaf person native of the chosen sign language, who is not the signer recording the video is important to confirm that it can be understood. Professional interpreters recording videos usually offer this option.
