### File type

Generally speaking JPG/ JPEG files work well for photos and PNG files work well for logos and simple illustrations.

### File size

If you use large image sizes in your forms and surveys, it takes longer for the server to load the page when a user arrives on it it.   Smaller image sizes tend to load more quickly across all devices.

Respondents will view the same file as the one uploaded to the image libary.   Therefore the smaller and lighter the the better without losing image quality.

The platform will not allow you to upload a file size larger than 3MB.  However for Easy Read images render well with a file size of around 500 KB.

### File ratio

Square images (1:1 aspect) work best for ER images on the platform.  However the most important thing is to keep the ratios consistent for all ER images.
