# How can I get feedback about my survey?

## Question

"Having invested time and money in creating an accessible survey on Accessible Surveys, I am keen to get feedback from people who have completed the survey. &#x20;

It would be useful to know what aspects of the survey they enjoyed or would like to see improved.   Is there an easy why of doing this?"

## Answer

Many customers choose to include several questions at the end of their survey to gether this type of feedback.  Here is worked example which you can use if you like.

### &#x20;Step 1

Drag and drop a 'rating' question to the end of your form as shown below.

### Step 2

We suggest you edit the question as follows:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot showing how the rating question can be presented</p></figcaption></figure>

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="82" valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>1</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Add the question label "Did you like this survey?"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>2</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Check the box for a more accessible label variant so the text will wrap on small screens</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>3</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Add the the helper text "10 stars means you loved it and 1 star means you really didn't like it."</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>4</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Ask respondents to rate your survey out of 10 stars</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Step 3

Add two additional 'Long text" questions with the following labels:

"Please tell us what you liked about the survey"

"Please tell us what you did not like about the survey"

We suggest you edit Long text questions as follow:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="74" valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>1</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Add the question label</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>2</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Check the box for a more accessible label variant so the text will wrap on small screens</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><mark style="color:red;"><strong>3</strong></mark></td><td valign="top">Enter 5 layout rows so a good size text box is presented</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Step 4

Add a 'Single checkbox' question so that it appear after the question "Please tell us what you liked about the survey" and before the question "Please tell us what you did not like about the survey" as show below.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot showing a 'Single checkbox' question being added to the form</p></figcaption></figure>

We suggest you edit the Single checkbox as follow:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot showing how the Single checkbox question can be presented</p></figcaption></figure>

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="95"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>1</strong></mark></td><td>Add the question label "Permission to share your feedback with others (we will not share your name or personal information)"</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>2</strong></mark></td><td>Under 'layout', add the checkbox label "You have my permission"</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Step 5

Add logical expressions so the follow up question only appear based on the rating given to the first feedback question "Did you like this survey?"

### Step

You only want to know about what the respondent liked about the survey and to get their permission to share their feedback if they have given a rating of 9 or 10 to the first question.

This can be acheived as follows:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="78"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>1</strong></mark></td><td>Highlight the first question you want to apply the logic to in the tree structure</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>2</strong></mark></td><td>Toggle on the 'Advanced' tab</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>3</strong></mark></td><td>Select the 'logic' item from the task toolbar</td></tr></tbody></table>
