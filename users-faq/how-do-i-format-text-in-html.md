# How do I format text in html?

### Question

Certain fields of Preignition, such as [notifications](https://program-user-docs.preignition.org/~/edit/drafts/-LFWl9S-Pg03NHvFiFEh/users-faq/how-do-i-format-text-in-html), currently require users to format text using html.  I am not familiar with html and so need some help.

### Answer

We intend to develop Preignition so that text can be formatted without users needing to use html.  For now some basic knowledge of html is required.

The following guidance is taken from a website called [Tutorials Point.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_basic_tags.htm)  Tutorials Point includes a lot more information about html but we do not expert users to become html experts.  Therefore if you need help with html, or you want to do something which is not covered below please contact help@preignition.org.

### Heading Tags

Most documents start with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML has six levels of headings, which use the elements **&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;,** and **&lt;h6&gt;**. While displaying any heading, a browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

#### Example

```text
      <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
      <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
      <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
      <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
      <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
      <h6>This is heading 6</h6>             
 
 This will produce the following result âˆ’
This is heading 1
This is heading 2
This is heading 3
This is heading 4
This is heading 5
This is heading 6


Bold
```
