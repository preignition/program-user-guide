# How do I change the active program

### Question

I use preignition to manage multiple programs.  How do I change the active program?

### Answer

It is straight forward to move between multiple programs.  See the section '[Step 6- Program management](https://program-user-docs.preignition.org/~/edit/drafts/-LFbjuf3-Z5T8aSWREUs/users-program-and-advanced/portfolio/settings/my-profile)' in the 'My profile' page.
