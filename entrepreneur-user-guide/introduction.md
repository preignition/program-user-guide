# Introduction

The audience for this guide are entrepreneurs who use Preignition to apply to and communicate with business support programs and their investor network.

Entrepreneurs only access a few areas of the platform such as the homepage and entrepreneurs space. 

The user experience for entrepreneurs is highly intuitive and there should be no need to refer to this User Guide.

Please contact help@preignition.org if these instructions are not clear or if you still have questions.
