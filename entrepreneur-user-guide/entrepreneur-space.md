# Entrepreneur space

## Step 1-  Overview of the 'entrepreneur space'

* Once an entrepreneur has created an account on preignition and applied to a program, they will automatically be directed to their 'entrepreneur space'
* The entrepreneur space is customized to reflect the branding of the program that the entrepreneur has applied for.

## Step 2-  Bulletin board

* This is where entrepreneurs will receive messages and calls to action from the program they have applied to.
* For instance an entrepreneur maybe invited to [complete a survey](completing-a-survey.md).  

## Step 3- User Profile

* The entrepreneur can also edit their [User Profile](user-profile.md) from their entrepreneur space.
