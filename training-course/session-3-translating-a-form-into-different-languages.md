# Session 3- Translating a survey

## Session overview

In session 2, you added accessibility options to your survey.

In this session you will learn how to translate your survey into French and Spanish.

The platform supports a very wide range of languages. The process you will learn here applies to any language you would like to offer your survey in.

## Learning outcomes

On completing this session, you should feel confident to;

* [x] Add new languages for your organisation, either yourself or with the support of the Account Holder
* [x] Translate your survey into any new languages that have been added
* [x] Testing the translated versions of your survey
* [x] Translating questions that have been added or amended
* [x] Know how surveys which are available in multiple languages are presented to survey respondents

## Activating New Languages

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Account Holders can activate additional languages for their organisation
{% endhint %}

New languages are added for an organisation from the 'Customer Portal'. Only Account Holders have access to the Customer Portal.

You will be an Account Holder if you created the account for your organisation on Accessible Surveys or have been subsequently been added as an Account Holder.

When signed into your account, you will be able to view and access the 'Customer' portal from the homepage.

If you are not an Account Holder, when signed in to your account you will not be able to view or access the 'Customer' portal from the homepage.

If French and Spanish haven't already been added for your organisation, you will need to ask an Account Holder to add them for your so you can complete this training session.
