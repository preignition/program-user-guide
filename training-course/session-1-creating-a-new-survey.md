# Session 1- Creating a new survey

## Session Overview

This session guides you through the process of creating a new survey and adding questions to your Form.  &#x20;

It explains how a Form is structured using Pages, Sections and Questions and introduces some commonly used question types.   It also shows how you can test your Form as you build it.&#x20;

Once you have added some questions, it shows how to add form logic so respondents are only asked relevant questions.

Lastly it will show you how to 'Publish' your Form and how to grant your team members access rights to your Form.

This first session is slightly longer than the other sessions and will take approximately 45 mins to complete.  I hope that you enjoy it! &#x20;
