## Step 5

* The following is an example og how you can customise a simple text based question
* There are seperate guidance notes on text based, choiced based and media based question types which explain how to customize questions in more detail
* However common features of questions include:
  * 'label'- shows how the question will appear on a form
  * 'accessibility'- an option for additional accessibility features
  * 'helper text'- allows you to provide context to your respondents, such as why the question is important.   Helper text only appears when the feild is active
  * 'placeholder'- can also be used to add guidance or context.  Placeholder text is visible until overwritten by a respondents answer
  * 'required'- requires the respondent to answer the question in order to submit the survey
  * 'specific attributes' - varies depending on question
  * 'privacy'- excludes this feild from certain data exports
