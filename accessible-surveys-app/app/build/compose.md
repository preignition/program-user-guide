# Build — Compose

## Summary

Compose is where you structure your form: pages, sections, and questions.

## Features

- Pages and sections: add, rename, reorder via drag‑and‑drop.
- Questions: text, choice, media, rating, order, range, and free‑text blocks.
- Reuse options: share option lists across questions.
- Logic markers: quick badges for visibility and requirements.
- Accessibility helpers: label position, inline radio, Specify Other.

## How it works

1) Create pages, then add questions inside sections.
2) Configure each question’s label, help, validation, and display.
3) Use drag‑and‑drop to reorder; use the context menu to duplicate or delete.
4) Use logic or behavior (next tab) to control visibility and validation.
