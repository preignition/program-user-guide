# Build — Form Behavior

## Summary

Form Behavior controls navigation, validation, and defaults that affect the whole form.

## Features

- Navigation: next/previous, page menu visibility, skip hidden pages.
- Validation: per‑page checks before moving forward and before submit.
- Required rules: make questions or pages mandatory.
- Defaults: font size, contrast, read‑aloud availability.
- Keyboard focus: focus returns to the current page’s header/first input.

## How it works

1) Choose when validation runs (on page change, on submit) and how errors surface.
2) Decide if the page menu shows hidden pages; typically, hide them.
3) Set accessibility defaults (e.g., larger font, high contrast) for your audience.
4) Test navigation with keyboard to confirm expected focus management.
