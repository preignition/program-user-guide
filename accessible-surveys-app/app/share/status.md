# Share — Status

## Summary

Status shows whether your form is ready to publish and highlights issues to fix.

## Features

- Build health: errors and warnings (missing translations, invalid logic, unused items).
- Readiness checklist: must‑fix vs. recommended improvements.
- Timestamps: last build, last publish, pending changes since publish.

## How it works

- Resolve must‑fix issues before you can publish.
- Use the list to jump directly to problematic questions/pages.
- Rebuild after fixes to refresh status.
