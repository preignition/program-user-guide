# Share — Publish

## Summary

Publish creates a versioned, read‑only build that respondents will use.

## Features

- Versioning: create immutable versions; roll back to a previous version.
- Environments: publish to test or production.
- Scheduling: set availability window (start/end dates).

## How it works

1) Ensure Status shows no blocking issues.
2) Choose environment and version label, then publish.
3) Optionally schedule activation and expiry.
4) Use roll back if a regression is found after release.
