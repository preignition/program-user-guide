# Share — Account Type

## Summary

Control whether respondents need accounts or can answer anonymously.

## Features

- Anonymous responses: no sign‑in required.
- Named accounts: require sign‑in; track by user.
- Session recovery: allow resuming partially completed forms.

## How it works

1) Choose Anonymous for frictionless access or Accounts for identity.
2) If using accounts, confirm your organization’s sign‑in options.
3) Enable resume so respondents can continue later without losing progress.
