# Share — Access

## Summary

Define who can view, edit, and publish the form, and protect respondent access.

## Features

- Team roles: owner, editor, viewer with scoped rights.
- Form access: private, link‑only, password/code protected.
- Respondent permissions: per‑app/user rights for editing/publishing.

## How it works

1) Set team and form permissions according to your governance policy.
2) Use link‑only or codes to prevent unwanted respondents.
3) Review access regularly, especially before publishing updates.
