# Session 3- Translating a survey

## Session Overview

In session 2, you added accessibility options to your survey.

In this session, you will translate your survey into French and Spanish.

Accessible Surveys supports a very wide range of languages.

The process you will learn here applies to any language.

## Learning Outcomes

On completing this session, you should feel confident;

* [x] Adding new languages for your 'Organization'
* [x] Translating your survey into any new languages that have been added
* [x] Testing the translated versions of your survey
* [x] Translating questions that have been subsequently added or amended
* [x] Knowing how language options are presented to survey respondents

## Activating Additional Languages

{% hint style="info" %}
Only 'Account Holders' can activate additional languages for their 'Organization' as this related to the organization's subscription plan.
{% endhint %}

Additional languages are added for an 'Organization' from the 'Customer Portal'. Only 'Account Holders' have access to the 'Customer Portal'.

You will be an 'Account Holder' if you created the account for your 'Organization' on Accessible Surveys or have been subsequently been added as an 'Account Holder'.

When signed into your account, you will be able to view and access the 'Customer' portal from the homepage.

If you are a 'Team Member' but not an 'Account Holder', when signed in to your account you will not be able to view or access the 'Customer' portal from the homepage.

If French and Spanish haven't already been added for your 'Organization', you will need to ask an 'Account Holder' to add them for your 'Organization' so you can complete this training session.
