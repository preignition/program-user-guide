# Session 2- Adding accessibility options

In session 1, you created a new survey, added an 'Introduction Page', a 'Thank You Page' and some 'Questions' to your 'Form'.

In this session, you will learn how to add accessibility features including sign language, Easy Read, Read aloud and voice recording.

## Learning Outcomes

On completing this session, you should feel confident;

* [x] Using the 'Form Behavior' menu to activate accessibility modes
* [x] Creating an Easy Read version of your survey
* [x] Adding a sign language to your survey
* [x] Choosing a Read Aloud voice for your survey
* [x] Understanding how the Voice Recording option works

{% hint style="info" %}
The 'Training Survey' supports British Sign Language (BSL). You can offer whichever sign language you choose and even offer multiple sign languages.
{% endhint %}

## Learning Materials

You will need the following learning materials for this session.

### Links for British Sign Language (BSL) videos

When you add BSL videos to your 'Training Survey', you will need these Youtube links.

Simply copy the 11 digit Youtube ID into the appropriate place in your survey. The training video will show you how!

<table><thead><tr><th width="442">Question</th><th>Youtube ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.1 'Which survey tool does your organisation use the most?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/dsL489ipJxM">dsL489ipJxM</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.2 'I am satisifed with my current survey tool'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/6KxVTBEfcUQ">6KxVTBEfcUQ</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.3 'What do you like about the survey tool you are using?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/4LfklqWfq3A">4LfklqWfq3A</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.4 'What frustrates you about the survey tool that you are using?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/hK1L5y5iRds">hK1L5y5iRds</a></td></tr><tr><td>2.1 'Do you like this survey?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/Zne0RX2she4">Zne0RX2she4</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

Currently survey builders need to create their own sign language videos. If required, we can provide details of recommended sign language service providers.

### Easy Read Images

When you add Easy Read images to your survey, these images are the ones to use.

| <img src="assets/1 ER image for Survey.png" alt="Easy Read image for 'Which survey tool does your organisation use the most?'" width="100%"> | <img src="assets/2 ER image for Satisfaction.png" alt="Easy Read image for 'I am satisifed with my current survey tool'" width="100%"> | <img src="assets/3 ER image for what do you like.png" alt="Easy Read image for 'What do you like about the survey tool you are using?'" width="100%"> |
| <img src="assets/4 ER image for what frustrates you.png" alt="Easy Read image for 'What frustrates you about the survey tool that you are using?'" width="100%"> | <img src="assets/5 ER image do you like this survey.png" alt="Easy Read image for 'Do you like this survey?'" width="100%"> | |

I suggest you download these into a separate folder on your computer before you start the session. The video will show you how to add the images to your survey.

{% hint style="info" %}
These images are sourced from [Easy on the i](https://www.learningdisabilityservice-leeds.nhs.uk/easy-on-the-i/). This is a great library of free symbols, photos and graphics which can be used when creating Easy Read surveys.
