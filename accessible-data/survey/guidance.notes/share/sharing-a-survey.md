# Sharing a Survey

{% hint style="info" %}
A survey must be 'Published' before it can be used in a survey.  If a survey is changed, a new version must be 'Published' before the changes are seen by respondents.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

To 'Share' a survey, go 'Deploy' in the top menu of the survey builder and select 'Share'

## Step 2

Select 'Create and Share a New Version'

## Step 3

You will be prompted to give the version a label. This will help you to differentiate between different versions of the survey that have been Shared

## Step 4

The grid shows summary information about the different versions of the survey that have been Shared

The current version will be marked with a![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (2).png>)

## Step 5

Clicking on a row in the grid, shows some additional information about the version

When a survey is 'shared' the application runs a number of checks on the survey to make sure there are no obvious errors.   &#x20;

In this example the survey has been sucessfully shared and is available in English and French

In this example the version build was not sucessful. The error is identified and an option is provided to edit the survey so the error can be corrected

## Step 6

Right clicking on a row on the Version grid provides a way of deleting or rolling back a version so it becomes the current version

## Step 7

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations!  You know how to 'Share' a survey so that it can be used in a survey
