# Editing a survey

## Step 1

To create a new survey see the how to guide [Creating a new survey.](../creating-a-new-survey.md)

This page shows you how to edit a survey. &#x20;

Start by clicking on the 'Survey Editor' feild&#x20;

## Step 2

Under the 'settings' tab you can edit the survey name, give it a label and select the form you want to use to collect data.

We recommend always using the latest version of the form, unless you have specific reason for selecting an earlier version.

## Step 3

The activation feild describes whether the survey is currently 'active'.   The survey must be active in order for responses to be saved to the database.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order for a survey to be active, the batch settings must have a 'from date' which is in the past and a 'to date' which is in the future or left blank.  The survey must also be published
{% endhint %}
