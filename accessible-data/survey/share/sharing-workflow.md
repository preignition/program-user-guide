# Sharing Workflow

Sharing a survey involves several steps to ensure it reaches the right audience and is accessible at the right time. Follow this workflow to successfully launch your survey.

## 1. Define Access Rights

Before sharing, decide who can access your survey.

- **[Account Types](./account/README.md)**: Choose whether your survey is public (Anonymous), requires login (Verified), or is restricted to specific email addresses.
- **[Access Permissions](./access/README.md)**: If you are collaborating with a team, set up permissions for who can edit or view the survey results.

## 2. Configure Availability

Control when your survey is live.

- **[Batches](./batch/README.md)**: Set start and end dates for your survey. A survey must be part of an active batch to be accessible.
- **[Status](./status/README.md)**: Manually open or close the survey if needed.

## 3. Publish Your Survey

Make your latest changes live.

- **[Publish](./publish/README.md)**: You must publish your survey for any changes (including new questions or settings) to take effect.

## 4. Distribute

Get your survey in front of respondents.

- **[Distribute](./distribute/README.md)**: Get the direct link, QR code, or embed code.
- **[Email](./message/README.md)**: Send invitations directly from the platform.

## 5. Monitor and Manage

- **[Webhooks](./webhooks/README.md)**: Set up real-time data integration.
- **[Redirection](./redirection/README.md)**: Decide where users go after completing the survey.
