## Interface Overview

The **Account Types** page lets you define who is eligible to take your survey.

- **Anonymous**: Allows anyone with the link to take the survey. No login is required.
- **Verified Users**: Requires respondents to log in to their account before accessing the survey. This ensures one response per person and tracks user identity.
- **Email Invite Only**: Restricts access to a specific list of email addresses. Each respondent receives a unique link.

Select the appropriate option to enforce the desired level of security and access control for your survey.
