    - **Version**: The version number (e.g., v1, v2).
    - **Date**: When this version was published.
    - **Published By**: The user who published this version.
    - **Status**: Indicates which version is currently live.

# Publishing surveys

{% hint style="success" %}
Any changes made to your survey must be 'published' before they become effective.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You can publish a survey from the 'Settings' menu under Survey Definition. Select 'publish' in the top right corner

You will receive a notification that the survey has been published and the 'last published' date will be updated

## Step 2

A survey can be unpublished at any time from the survey settings page. This will unactivate the survey, meaning that it can no longer be responded to.

It can republished at any time.

# Publishing a form

{% hint style="info" %}
A form must be 'Published' before it can be used in a survey.  If a form is changed, a new version must be 'Published' before the changes are seen by respondents.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

To 'Publish' a form, go 'Deploy' in the top menu of the form builder and select 'Publish'

## Step 3

Select 'Create and Publish a New Version'

## Step 4

You will be prompted to give the version a label. This will help you to differentiate between different versions of the form

## Step 5

The grid shows summary information about the different versions of the form that have been Published

The current version will be marked with a![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (2).png>)

## Step 6

Clicking on a row in the grid, shows some additional information about the version

When a form is 'published' the application runs a number of checks on the form to make sure there are no obvious errors.   &#x20;

In this example the form has been sucessfully published and is available in English and French

![Screenshot showing an example of a form that has been published sucessfully](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (305) (1).png>)

In this example the version build was not sucessful. The error is identified and an option is provided to edit the form so the error can be corrected

## Step 7

Right clicking on a row on the Version grid provides a way of deleting or rolling back a version so it becomes the current version

## Step 8

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations!  You know how to 'Publish' a form so that it can be used in a survey
{% endhint %}
