# Survey Batches

Batches allow you to send your survey to a large list of respondents simultaneously, making it easy to manage large-scale survey distribution.

## Interface Overview


The **Batches** page is your control center for managing survey availability over time.

- **Batch List**: Displays all created batches with their names, start/end dates, and current status (Active, Scheduled, or Closed).
- **Create Batch**: Click "Create New Batch" to define a new availability window.
- **Batch Details**:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for the batch (e.g., "Q1 2024 Survey").
    - **Start Date**: The date and time when the survey becomes accessible.
    - **End Date**: The date and time when the survey automatically closes.
    - **Status**: Indicates if the batch is currently live. Only one batch can be active at a time.

## Why use Batches?

{% hint style="success" %}
In order for a survey to be active, it must be part of an active batch. This means the batch must have a 'from' date which is in the past and a 'to' date which is in the future or left blank.
{% endhint %}

*   **Control Availability**: Batches provide a way to control when your survey is active by setting a 'from' and 'to' date. Respondents clicking on a survey link outside of these dates will be informed that the survey is closed.
*   **Group Responses**: Batches also provide a way of grouping respondents based on when they completed a survey, as the data set can be filtered by 'batch'. This is helpful if you run annual surveys and want to be able to analyze results by year.

## How to Configure Batches

### Step 1: Navigate to Batch Settings

Batch settings can be found under the 'Survey Definition' menu.

## Analyzing Results

When analyzing survey results, responses can be filtered by batch to compare data across different time periods or distribution groups.
