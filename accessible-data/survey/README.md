# Introduction

This course accompanies new customers to create a short 'Training Survey'.  We have found this to be the best way to help new customers become familiar with the platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
On completing this course, you will feel confident building, testing, sharing and analyzing surveys on Accessible Surveys.
{% endhint %}

You should complete this course *before* creating your first survey.  Creating the 'Training Survey' will not count as part of your survey quota.

There is other help available. Please check our [Tutorials](../../tutorials/README.md), [Guidance Notes](../../guidance-notes/survey-app/README.md) and [FAQs](../../faq/introduction-to-faq/README.md).

## Structure of the Course

The course follows the life cycle of building, testing, sharing and analyzing a survey.  It is divided into 5 sessions:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options
3. Translating a survey into different languages
4. Testing and sharing your survey
5. Analyzing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

The training course does not cover every feature which is offered.

Links to [Guidance Notes](../../guidance-notes) which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant training session.

## Time Commitment

We estimate that it will take approximately 15 minutes to complete most sessions, although session 1 will take approximately 25 minutes.

Some people will take less time and some people will take more time. We encourage you to go at your own pace and revisit sessions if needed.

It is likely to take between 1-2 hours to complete the entire training course. We recognize that this is a significant investment of your time but are confident that it will be time well spent.

## Training Materials

We provide the following training materials to help you create your training survey.

- [x] Text for your 'Introductory Page' and 'Thank You Page'
- [x] Survey questions
- [x] Easy Read images
- [x] British Sign Language videos

Each training session includes links to any training materials needed to complete that session.

{% hint style="info" %}
We suggest that you download training materials onto your computer before you start the session.
