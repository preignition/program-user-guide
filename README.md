# TRAINING GUIDE

## Introduction

This Training Guide accompanies new users to create their first survey on Accessible Surveys.  By following the guide and creating a 'Training Survey',  users will be introduced to all the key features of Accessible Surveys.  On completing the guide, new users will be able to create their own surveys.

This Training Guide complements and refers to the other on-line help that is available in the form of Tutorials, Guidance Notes and Frequently Asked Questions. &#x20;

## Structure of the guide

This Training Guide follows the natural process of creating, sharing and analying a survey and is divided into 5 sections:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options to a form
3. Translating a form into different languages
4. Sharing and testing your survey using the survey editor
5. Analysing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

Each section will take approximately 30 minutes to complete although you are welcome to go at your own speed and return to sections if necessary.

Each section has its own learning outcomes.&#x20;

The training guide does not cover every feature which is offered.  Links to Guidance Notes which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant section.
