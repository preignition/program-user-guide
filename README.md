# Introduction

## Introduction

This training course will accompany you to create a short 'Training Survey on Accessible Surveys' for demonstration purposes.

This process will familiarise you with the platform and introduce you to all the key features of Accessible Surveys.

{% hint style="success" %}
On completing this training course, you should feel confident building, testing, sharing and analysing surveys on Accessible Surveys.
{% endhint %}

This training course complements the other on-line help that is available in the form of Tutorials, Guidance Notes and Frequently Asked Questions.

You should complete this course before creating your own surveys on Accessible Surveys.

## Structure of the Course

The course follows the natural process of building, testing, sharing and analysing a survey and is divided into 5 sessions:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options to a Form
3. Translating a Form into different languages
4. Sharing your survey using the survey editor
5. Analysing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

The training course does not cover every feature which is offered. Links to Guidance Notes which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant section.

## Time Commitment

We estimate that it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete most sessions although session 1 will take approximately 45 mins . Some people will take less time and some people will take more time. We encourage you to go at your own pace and revisit sessions if needed.

This means that it is likely to take between 2-3 hours to complete the entire course. We recognise that this is a significant investment of time but are confident that it will save you a lot of time in the long run.
