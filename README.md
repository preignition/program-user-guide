# Introduction

### Introduction

This course accompanies you to create a short 'Training Survey'.

By creating a simple survey you will get to know the platform well.

{% hint style="success" %}
On completing the course, you will feel confident building, testing, sharing and analysing surveys on Accessible Surveys.
{% endhint %}

You should complete this course before creating your own surveys on Accessible Surveys.

There is other help available in the on-line help, including 'Tutorials', 'Guidance Notes' and 'Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQs)

### Structure of the Course

The course follows the process of building, testing, sharing and analysing a survey and is divided into 5 sessions:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options to a Form
3. Translating a Form into different languages
4. Sharing your survey
5. Analysing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

The training course does not cover every feature which is offered.

Links to Guidance Notes which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant section.

### Time Commitment

We estimate that it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete most sessions, although session 1 will take approximately 45 mins . Some people will take less time and some people will take more time. We encourage you to go at your own pace and revisit sessions if needed.

It is likely to take between 2-3 hours to complete the entire course. We recognise that this is a significant investment of your time but are confident that it will be time well spent.
