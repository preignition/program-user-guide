## Structure of the Guide

This Training Guide follows the natural process of creating, sharing and analying a survey and is divided into 5 sessions:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options to a form
3. Translating a form into different languages
4. Sharing and testing your survey using the survey editor
5. Analysing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

The Training Guide does not cover every feature which is offered.  Links to Guidance Notes which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant section.

## Time Commitment

We estimate that it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete most sessions although session 1 will take aproximately 45 mins .  Some people will take less time and some people will take more time.  We encourage you to go at your own pace and revisit sessions if needed.

This means that it is likely to take between 2-3 hours to complete the entire course.  We recognise that this is a significant investment of time but are confident that it will save you a lot of time in the long run.
