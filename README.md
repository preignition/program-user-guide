# TRAINING GUIDE

## Introduction

This Training Guide accompanies you to create your first survey on Accessible Surveys. &#x20;

By following this guide and using the training materials provided, you willl create a demonstration 'Training Survey'.

Through this hands on on-line training exercise, you will be introduced to the key features of Accessible Surveys.

{% hint style="success" %}
On completing the training, you will feel confident building, testing, sharing and analysing surveys on Accessible Surveys.
{% endhint %}

This Training Guide complements the other on-line help that is available in the form of Tutorials, Guidance Notes and Frequently Asked Questions. &#x20;

The Training Guide assumes you have created an account on Accessible Surveys and have access to the survey application.

## Structure of the guide

This Training Guide follows the natural process of creating, sharing and analying a survey and is divided into 5 sections:

1. Creating a new survey.
2. Adding accessibility options to a form
3. Translating a form into different languages
4. Sharing and testing your survey using the survey editor
5. Analysing your survey responses and exporting your survey data

The training guide does not cover every feature which is offered.  Links to Guidance Notes which cover additional and advanced features are provided under the relevant section.

## Time Commitment

We estimate that it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete each section.  Some people will take less time and some people will take more time.  We encourage you to go at your own pace and revisit sections if you need to.

This means that it is likely to take between 2-3 hours to complete the entire course.  Although this is a significant investment of time it will save you a lot of time in the long run.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you are through the learning curve of using a new platform you will be able to create accessible surveys easily and quickly.
