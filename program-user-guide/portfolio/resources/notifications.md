* From the notification page a user can view, edit and create messages to be sent to entrepreneurs either via email or a message which appears on the entrepreneur's bulletin board.
* The person who creates the template will be shown as the 'owner' 
* The date the template was last modified is also shown.

### Step 2- Viewing or editing a notification template

* To view or edit a notification template simply double click on the relevant template
* Alternatively you can right click and select the 'edit' option

### Step 3- Creating a new notification template

### Step 4- Overview of a notification template

The important elements of a notification template are as follows:

**Title and description**

* These are used for internal purposes to keep track of different templates.  Neither the title or the description is seen by entrepreneurs

**Title template and excerpt template**

* The 'title template' is the main title given in an email or message on the bulletin board
* The 'excerpt template' appears as the first line in a email or message on the bulletin board

**html content template**

* This is where the main text is created or edited.
* html is currently used for formatting.  
* For help with html refer the FAQ entitled '[How do I format text in html](https://program-user-docs.preignition.org/~/edit/drafts/-LFXK6WGPDS_uBptFmkc/users-faq/how-do-i-format-text-in-html)?'

**Text content template**

* This section is not needed and will be removed in the future

### Step 5- Updating a notification template

In order for changes to a notification template to take effect they must be 'published'.

If the publish button is in grey it means that you don't have permission to edit the notification template.

Further work is needed to make it easy for a user to edit and create notification templates and to specify when the template will be used.  If you need assistance please contact help@preignition.org
