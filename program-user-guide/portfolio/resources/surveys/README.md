# Survey

## Step 1- Introduction to Surveys

Business support programs can use surveys to collect information from businesses either at the selection stage or later in their program's life cycle.  For instance information can be collected on a periodic basis to measure and report on the progress that a business has made.

Programs design their own surveys and responses can be manually reviewed or automatically scored. 

## Step 2- Overview of the Survey page
