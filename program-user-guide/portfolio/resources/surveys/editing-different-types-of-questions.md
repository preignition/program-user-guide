* Each choice based question is edited slightly differently.
* However the main different between editing choice based questions and text based questions, is that the former frequently have an addition 'options' tab, where you specify the options the respondent can choose from.

## Step 3- Media based questions

* Media based questions mean that you can ask respondents to upload a broad range of files, including documents, pictures, soundtracks and videos.
* Editing a media based question is straight forward. 
* Simply give it a label and placeholder and decide whether to make it a required question.

## Step 4- Fields

* The only option here is 'free text'.  
* 'Free text' allows you to enter a text box anywhere you like within your survey.
* Mark down is supported if you want to customize the look and feel of the text box.
