# Moving a business through the selection process

## Step 1- On a 'review' node, click on the box beside a business name.

![A single or multiple businesses can be selected](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only users with appropriate authorization rights can change the status of a business
{% endhint %}

* The banner at the top of the page changes and shows the number of businesses that have been selected. An options menu appears on the right-hand side

![In this example, 2 business have been selected](../../../.gitbook/assets/image-30.png)

## Step 2- Change the status of the selected business

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
The options are always to reject the business or move it to the next stage in the selection process
{% endhint %}

## Step 3- Confirm your choice

* As a safeguard a user will always be asked to confirm the changes they are about to make

## Step 4- Refresh the page

* The page needs to be refreshed in order for these changes to take effect. In the future this will happen automatically

## Step 5- Notifications

The selection process can be set up to automatically notify applicants when they have been moved to a different stage of a selections process. Notifications can appear on the applicants bulletin board or be emailed or both.
