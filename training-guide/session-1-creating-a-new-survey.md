# Session 1- Creating a new survey

## Session Overview

This session will guide you though the process of creating a new survey and adding questions to your Form.   It explains how a Form is structured using Pages, Sections and Questions and introduces you to some commonly used question types.   It also shows you how you can test your form as you build it.&#x20;

Once you have added some question it will show you how to add simple form logic so respondents are only asked relevant questions.

Lastly it will show you how to 'publish' your Form and how to grant your team mates access rights to your Form.

The session is slightly longer than the other sessions and will take approximately 45 mins to complete.  I hope that you enjoy it! &#x20;
