Additional languages are activated for an organisation from the 'Customer Portal'.  Only Account Holders have access to the Customer Portal.

You will be an Account Holder if you created an account for your organisation on Accessible Surveys or have been subsequently been added as an Account Holder.  When signed into your account, you will be able to view and access the 'Customer' portal from the homepage.
