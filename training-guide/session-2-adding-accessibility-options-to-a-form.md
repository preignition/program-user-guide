{% endhint %}

## Learning Materials

You will need the following learning materials for this session.

#### Links for British Sign Language (BSL) videos

When you come to add BSL video to your form these Youtube links will come in handy.  Simply copy the link into the appropriate place in your form.  The training video will show you how!

<table><thead><tr><th width="442">Question</th><th>Youtube ID for BSL video</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.1  'Which survey tool does your organisation use the most?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/dsL489ipJxM">dsL489ipJxM</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.2  'I am satisifed with my current survey tool'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/6KxVTBEfcUQ">6KxVTBEfcUQ</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.3  'What do you like about the survey tool you are using?' </td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/4LfklqWfq3A">4LfklqWfq3A</a></td></tr><tr><td>1.4  'What frustrates you about the survey tool that you are using?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/hK1L5y5iRds">hK1L5y5iRds</a></td></tr><tr><td>2.1  'Do you like this survey?'</td><td><a href="https://youtu.be/Zne0RX2she4">Zne0RX2she4</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently survey builders need to create their own sign language videos.   If required, we can provide details of recommended sign language service providers.
{% endhint %}

#### Easy Read Images

When you come to adding Easy Read images to your Form, these images are the ones to use.  I suggest you download these into a seperate folder on you computer before you start the session.  The video will show you how to add the images to the correct place in your Form.
