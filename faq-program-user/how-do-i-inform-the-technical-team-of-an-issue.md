# How do i inform the Preignition team of a technical issue?

### Question 

I have encountered a technical issue with Preignition.  How do I inform the Preignition team?

### Answer

If the issue is straight forward you are welcome to email your contact at Preignition directly or email help@preignition.org

However the best way of keeping track of issues is to record them in Gitlab.

### Step 1-  Log into your gitlab account

* Go to the gitlab sign-in page which can be accessed [here](https://gitlab.furqansoftware.net/users/sign_in).
* Sign in using the username and password that you will have been provided with.  Select the 'remember me' box so you don't have to sign in each time.

### Step 2-  Enter two-factor authentication code

* The first time you log in and then periodically you will be asked to enter a two-factor authentication code.

* To obtain the code you will need to download the 'Google Authenticator' from the play store

* It is noted that occasionally the authentication code is not accepted.

* This is sometimes caused by a slight time delay between the authentication codes being generated by Google and recognised by gitlab.  
* If this happens, write down the google authentication code and enter approx 10 seconds after the new code has been generated. 
* If you still have problems contact help@preignition.org

### Step 3- Go to the Preignition project

* Once logged into Gitlab you will see a list of all your active projects.
* The main Preignition project is indicated below.

* Double clicking on the Preignition project will bring up the following screen.
* From here the most relevant menu option is 'Issues'

### Step 4-  Raising an issue in Gitlab

* To raise a new issue select 'issues' from the left hand menu and select 'New Issue'

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28100%29.png)

* Give the issue a title and describe it in the box below.
* Then assign it to the relevant person, currently Christophe Geiser.
* There is no need to allocate a milestone or label.  This will be done by the Preignition team.
* You can copy screen shots directly in the description field.  You are encouraged to provide screen shots so we can visualize the problem.
* The 'preview' screen shows how the issue will actually appear.

* If you raise an issue you will automatically be informed when the issue has been commented on and/ or resolved.

### Step 5- Viewing issues on Gitlab

* There are various ways of viewing issues on Gitlab
* They can be viewed as a single list, a board, by label or by milestone

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2889%29.png)

* The board view is especially helpful as it shows the status of the issue.
* Further filters can also be applied, eg by 'label'
