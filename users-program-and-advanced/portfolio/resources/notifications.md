* From the notification page a user can view, edit and create messages to be sent to entrepreneurs either via email or a message which appears on the entrepreneur's bulletin board.
* The person who creates the template will be shown as the 'owner' 
* The date the template was last modified is also shown.

### Step 2- Viewing or editing a notification template

* To view or edit a notification template simply double click on the relevant template
* Alternatively you can right click and select the 'edit' option

The important elements of a notification template are as follows:

**Title and description**

* These are used for internal purposes to keep track of different templates.  Neither the title or the description is seen by entrepreneurs

**Title template and excerpt template**

* The 'title template' is the main title given to an email or message on the bulletin board
* The 'excerpt template' appears as the first line in a email of message on the bulletin board

**html content template**

* This section is not needed and will be removed in the future

### Step 5- Updating a notification template

In order for changes to a notification template to take effect they must be 'published'.

If the publish button is in grey it means that you don't have permission to edit the notification template.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Further work is needed to make it easy for a User to edit and create notification templates and to specify when the template will be used.  
{% endhint %}
