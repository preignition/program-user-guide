# Categories- Beta

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section is in beta format.  For now users will need help creating categories
{% endhint %}

### Step 1- Introduction to Categories

* Categories provide a way for users to group businesses
* Categories can used in a variety of ways
* For example, TBN Kenya have set up a 'business pre-review' category to make an initial assessment of applicants by grouping them into one of the following categories:
  * Pre-select
  * Consider
  * Drop

* Grouping businesses in this way enables TBN Keyna to focus their efforts on reviewing business which have been categorized as 'Consider'.  
* 'Pre-select' business are likely to be accepted to the next stage of the selection process, whereas 'Drop' businesses are likely to be rejected. 

### Step 2- Overview of the Category page

### Step 5- Overview of a Category template

* The important elements of a notification template are as follows:

**Title** 

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

* This is the name of the Category

**Documentation** 

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2850%29.png)

* This is an internal description of the category and is not visible to entrepreneurs

**Category labels**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2855%29.png)

* This is whether the category labels are defined
* Category labels can be added or deleted using the buttons on the right hand side.
* This section is not needed and will be removed in the future

### Step 5- Updating a Category

* In order for changes to a Category template to take effect they must be 'published'.

* If the publish button is in grey it means that you don't have permission to edit the Category template.
