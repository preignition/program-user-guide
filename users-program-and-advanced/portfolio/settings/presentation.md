{% hint style="warning" %}
The Presentation page currently requires a knowledge of mark down to ensure proper formatting of a program's logo.  Contact help@preignition.org if you need assistance

### Step 1- Each program has its own 'landing page' 

Each program has it's own 'landing page' on Preignition.  This enables a program to customize the way it present itself to entrepreneurs.

**Program title \(1\)-**  This is the title of the program

**Program logo \(2\)-** The program logo.  Currently mark down is used to present this properly.  In the future a Program will simply be able to upload their logo.

**Program summary \(3\)-** Program summary appears at the beginning of the description field after the logo.  Mark down has been used to format the summary so that it stands out.

**Program description \(4\)**- Where the program is described.
