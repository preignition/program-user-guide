# Presentation

## Step 1

The presentation page appears as an option in the settings menu in the left hand column

## Step 2

The presentation page allows you to:

* Name your organisation
* Upload a logo for your organisation
* Provide a short overview of your organisation
* Provide a more detailed description of your organisation

Markdown is supported so you can format your text and easily add images or videos.  See the how to note '[Using Markdown](../survey-app/form-editor/introduction-to-markdown.md)' for more information

## Step 3

The presentation page can be translated into any languages which are activated for the program.

Automated translation is currently only available for forms.  Translation in other parts of the application needs to be done manually.
