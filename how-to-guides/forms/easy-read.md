# Easy Read

## Introduction

Forms should adapt to the needs and preferences of respondents.  Some respondents may want an Easy Read version of a form. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
“Making information easier to understand for people ... is about more than making your text size bigger and putting some symbols or pictures in your document.  It’s about working with people your information is for, finding out together how you can make the information useful and accessible for them. There are no quick answers, and it isn’t easy... but it can be fun.” ([EasyInfo, ‘About making information easier’](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/215923/dh\_121927.pdf))
{% endhint %}

Easy Read forms offer the following advantages:

1. Presented in a simplied interface
2. Selected pages, sections and questions can be either displayed or hidden in Easy Read mode
3. The text can be modified to make it easier to understand
4. Images can be added to complement questions

{% hint style="info" %}
The easy read version of the form renders the form and the interface differently, but answers to questions are stored in the same dataset as for other versions of the survey. In the analytics, it will be possible to visualize a subset of the data, consisting of answers submitted under the easy read version.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You must first enable the 'Easy Read' accessibility mode in the form.  &#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

* Under the build menu, select the form title in the structure grid in the left hand column
* Toggle on the 'advanced' mode
* An accessibility menu will appear
* Tick the 'Easy Read' box

### Step 2

You will see two additional menu options appear under the form definition menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (317) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 3

If you want to use images to complement question in your Easy Read form you must first add them to your Easy Read Libary

This can be done by uploading an image or dragging and dropping animage from your computer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (298) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important that you have the rights to use any images which you upload. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 4

Selecting 'Easy Read Version' in the form definition menu displays the form in the standard mode alongside the form in the Easy Read mode.

Initially the text in the Easy Read mode is derived from the standard mode.  However it can be edited here.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307) (1) (1).png>)

* The![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (302) (1) (1) (1).png>)emoji shows the text as it appears in the standard version of the form.  It can't be edited here.
* The ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (309) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)emoji shows the text as it appears in the Easy Read version of the form.  It can be edited here.
* Any changes to the Easy Read text will be highlighted in the 'Easy Read version' structure grid as shown above

{% hint style="info" %}
Pages, Sections, Questions and even Question Options can all be edited for Easy Read&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 5

It is possible to upload pictures or youtube videos to complement questions in Easy Read mode

These will appear to the left of the question&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (313) (1) (1).png>)



For videos, simply add the video link or ID in the box entitled 'Youtube Settings'

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (303) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 6

Toggling on the Visibility Modes toggle gives the option to make Pages, Sections or Questions visible or hidden for specific audiences

This is useful if you would like to present a shorter form in the Easy Read mode&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In this example the visibility settings make 'Section 1' visible in the standard mode but hidden on International Sign and Easy Read mode. &#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 7

The Easy Read version of a form can be tested in the usual way.  However this 'Easy Read' icon must be selected from the top menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (316) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 8

A new version of the form must be deloyed in order for any changes to the Easy Read version of the form to be published
