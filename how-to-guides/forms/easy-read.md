# Easy Read

## Context

Forms should adapt to the needs and preferences of respondents.  Some respondents may want an Easy Read version of a form. &#x20;

Easy Read forms are presented with a simplified interface.  It is possible to attach supporting images to questions and modify the text to use language which is easier to understand.

{% hint style="info" %}
“Making information easier to understand for people ... is about more than making your text size bigger and putting some symbols or pictures in your document.  It’s about working with people your information is for, finding out together how you can make the information useful and accessible for them. There are no quick answers, and it isn’t easy... but it can be fun.” ([EasyInfo, ‘About making information easier’](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/215923/dh\_121927.pdf))
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You must first enable the 'Easy Read' accessibility mode in the form.  &#x20;
