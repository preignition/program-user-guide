# Easy Read

## Introduction

Forms can adapt to the needs and preferences of Respondents.  Some Respondents may want an 'Easy Read' version of a Form. &#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
“Making information easier to understand for people ... is about more than making your text size bigger and putting some symbols or pictures in your document.  It’s about working with the people your information is for, finding out together how you can make the information useful and accessible for them. There are no quick answers, and it isn’t easy... but it can be fun.” ([EasyInfo, ‘About making information easier’](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/215923/dh\_121927.pdf))
{% endhint %}

'Easy Read' forms offer the following advantages:

1. Presented in a simplied interface
2. Selected Pages, Sections and Questions can be either displayed or hidden in 'Easy Read' mode
3. The text can be modified to make it easier to understand
4. Images can be added to complement Questions

{% hint style="info" %}
The 'Easy Read' version renders the Form and the interface differently, but answers to Questions are stored in the same dataset as for other versions of the survey. In the analytics, it is possible to visualize a subset of the data, consisting of answers submitted under the Easy Read version.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You must first enable the 'Easy Read' accessibility mode in the Form.  &#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

* Under the Build menu, select the Form title in the tree grid in the left hand column
* Toggle on the 'Advanced' mode
* An 'Accessibility' menu will appear
* Tick the 'Easy Read' box

## Step 2

You will see two additional menu options appear under the Form Definition menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (317) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 3

If you want to use images to complement Questions in your 'Easy Read' Form you must first add them to your 'Easy Read Libary'

This can be done by uploading an image or dragging and dropping an image from your computer

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (298) (1) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is your responsbility to make sure that you have the appropriate rights to use any images which you upload to your 'Easy Read Libary'
{% endhint %}

## Step 4

Selecting 'Easy Read Version' in the Form Definition menu displays the form in the standard mode alongside the Form in the Easy Read mode.

Initially the text in the Easy Read mode is the same as the text in the standard mode.  However it can be edited here.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307) (1) (1).png>)

* The![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (302) (1) (1) (1).png>)emoji shows the text as it appears in the standard version of the Form.  It can't be edited here.
* The ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (309) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)emoji shows the text as it appears in the Easy Read version of the Form.  It can be edited here.
* Any changes to the Easy Read text will be highlighted in the 'Easy Read Version' tree grid as shown above

{% hint style="info" %}
Pages, Sections, Questions and even Question Options can all be edited for Easy Read&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 5

It is possible to upload pictures or youtube videos to complement Questions in Easy Read mode

These will appear to the left of the Question&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (313) (1) (1) (1).png>)



For videos, simply add the video link or ID in the box entitled 'Youtube Settings'

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (303) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 6

Toggling on the 'Visibility Modes' button gives the option to make Pages, Sections or Questions visible or hidden for specific audiences

This is useful if you would like to present a shorter version of a Form in the Easy Read mode&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In this example, the visibility settings make 'Section 1' visible in the standard mode but hidden in 'International Sign' and 'Easy Read' mode &#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 7

The Easy Read version of a Form can be tested in the usual way.  However the 'Easy Read' icon must be selected from the top menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (316) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 8

A new version of the Form must be deloyed in order for any changes to the Easy Read version of the Form to be Published
