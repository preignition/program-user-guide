# Publishing a form

{% hint style="success" %}
A form must be 'Published' before it can be used in a survey
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

To 'Publish' a form, go 'Deploy' in the top menu of the form builder

## Step 2

Select 'Publish' from the menu in the left hand column

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (307).png>)

## Step 3

Select 'Create and Publish a New Version'

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (318).png>)

## Step 4

You will be promoted to give the version a label. This will help you to differentiate between versions of the form

## Step 5

The grid shows some summary information about the different versions of the form that have been Published

The current version will be marked with a![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (309) (1).png>)

## Step 6

Clicking on a row in the grid, shows some additional information about the version

In this example the form has been sucessfully published and is available in English and French

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (305) (1).png>)

In this example the Version build was not sucessful. The error is identified and an option is provided to edit the form so the error can be corrected

## Step 7

Right clicking on a row on the Version grid provides a way of deleting or rolling back a version so it become the current version
