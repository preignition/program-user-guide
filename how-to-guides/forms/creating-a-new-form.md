# Creating a new form

## Introduction

{% hint style="success" %}
Forms determine **what** information you collect from your Respondents
{% endhint %}

This page gives a brief overview of the following

* Creating a new form
* Adding questions
* Publishing a form

These topics are covered in more detail in seperate 'How To' notes

## Step 1

## Step 2

Give your new form a name and select 'confirm'

## Step 3

* Under 'designation' you can name the form for internal purposes.  This won't be visible to respondents and so will not need to be translated
* Under 'presentation' you can name the form for external purposes.  This will appear at the top of the form and will need to be translated into all active languages
