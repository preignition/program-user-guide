# Sign Language

{% hint style="success" %}
Forms adapt to the needs and preferences of Respondents.  Some Respondents may want questions to be presented to them in a sign language video &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You must first enable the 'International Sign' accessibility mode in the Form Behaviour page.  &#x20;

## Step 2

You will see an additional 'Sign Language' menu option appear under the Form Definition menu

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (327) (1).png>)

## Step 3

Selecting 'Sign Language' provides options to add sign langage videos to support questions.  It also allows you to hide Pages, Sections or Questions when the Sign Language mode is activated

## Step 4

By default the sign language icon is labelled 'International Sign'.  However this can be altered if another sign language is being used.

## Step 5

The structure of the Form is shown as a tree grid in the left hand column.  Pages and Sections can be expanded or collapsed

## Step 6

Visibility Modes can be applied to Pages, Sections or Questions.  This makes them visible to a specific audience only.  By default no Visibility Mode is applies, meaning the Page, Section or Question is visible to everyone.

Below is an example of a visbility mode being applied to a Section. &#x20;

In this example Section 1 will be visible in standard mode.  It will be hidden when either Sign Language or Easy Read modes are activated

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (333).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Visibility Mode is applied high in the tree grid structure, the Visibility Mode will automatically be applied to anything further down in the tree grid structure.  For example changes applied at the Page level will impact everything below it
