The other text based questions operate in the same way.  The only differences are as follows:

* Currency and number questions provide an options for setting a maximum and minimum value for answers
* Date questions require Respondents to enter a date in the format dd/mm/yyyy
* Email questions require Respondents to enter a recognised email format ie the answer must include @ to be accepted
* Long text gives an option to set the number of rows that will be visible and the maximum number of rows that are available
