# Adding questions to a form

## Step 1

* This guide assumes you have already created a form and added a page and section.
* Your screen will now look like this

## Step 2

* A list of question types is listed on the right hand side of the page
* Expanding the 'V' symbol by the 'text' option, provides some additional text based quesion types

## Step 3

* You can 'drag and drop' your prefered question type into the middle section of the page

## Step 5

* The following is an example of how you can customise a simple text based question
* There are seperate guidance notes on text based, choiced based and media based question types which explain how to customize questions in more detail
* However common features of questions include:
  * 'label'- shows how the question will appear on a form
  * 'accessibility'- an option for additional accessibility features
  * 'helper text'- allows you to provide context to your respondents, such as why the question is important.   Helper text only appears when the feild is active
  * 'placeholder'- can also be used to add guidance or context.  Placeholder text is visible until overwritten by a respondents answer
  * 'required'- requires the respondent to answer the question in order to submit the survey
  * 'specific attributes' - varies depending on question
  * 'privacy'- This feild will not appear in anonymised data exports&#x20;
