# Testing a form

{% hint style="success" %}
The 'Test' feature provides an easy way for you to see how your form will appear to respondents. You can test it out and make edits directly from the test page
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

In the form builder, the Test option appears in the top menu

## Step 2

Selecting Test will show you how your form appears to respondents.

Test completing the form to see how it reacts. If your form incorporates logic, this is a great time to check that it has been applied correctly.

## Step 3

Questions can be edited directly from the test page by selecting the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (331) (1).png>)icon which appears beside the question when it is focussed on

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (329) (1).png>)

## Step 4

The main difference between the test mode and the production moe which respondents see when they are completing a form is the top menu has different options.

In the Test mode the top menu has the following options:

| Option                                                      | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png>)           | View all content on the form, regardless of logic or accessibility modes              |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (3).png>)       | Test the form in any language that has been activativated for the Form                |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (296) (1) (1).png>)     | Activate Read Aloud                                                                   |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3) (1).png>)       | Activate Sign Language mode. This will only appear if applied as an accessiblity mode |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (302).png>)             | Activate Easy Read mode. This will only appear if applied as an accessibility mode    |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (308).png>)             | Adjust the zoom level so you can see more of the form in a single view                |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (306) (1).png>)         | Enables you to drag and drop the questions                                            |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (327) (1) (1) (1).png>) | Activates a 'comments' feature. This is explained below                               |
| ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (2).png>)          | View and clear test data so you can retest a blank form                               |

## Step 5

The comments feature ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (325) (1) (1) (1).png>) provides a powerful tool for users to collaborate when creating forms.

Users with the appropriate user rights can comment on questions, respond to other Users comments and mark comments as resolved

## Step 6

Once you have checked that your form is working smoothly, you are ready to 'Publish' the Form.

{% hint style="info" %}
Forms must be 'Published' before they can be used in surveys. If you have changed your form in any way, it must also be 'Published' before these changes become effective.
{% endhint %}
