# Translate forms

## Step 1

Additional langauge options must first be selected in your organisations main 'Settings' page.

Let us know if you would like an additional language which is not currently available on the app and we will do our best to support you.

## Step 2

Back in the form editor, you will see the additional languages you have selected when you go to the 'Localize' heading in the left hand menu and select 'Make this form multilingual'

## Step 3

You now have two options to automatically translate your form.  You will be able to adjust the translation manually later.

Option 1- Translate empty fields only.  This is a safe procedure where only non-translated feilds are automatically translated

Option2- Override translation.  This option overrides all previously translated feilds.  Manually edited feilds are lost.&#x20;

Once you have translated your form you will be able to see the translation in the tree strcuture in the left hand column.   The translated text can be manually translated.  Changes will be saved automatically.

## Step 4

Once you have translated your form you can test and edit your translations.

&#x20;Go to 'Test' in the top menu and select the language you would like to test.

You can edit questions directly from here.

However to edit Pages or Sections you will need to go back into the 'Localize' option in the 'Build' menu
