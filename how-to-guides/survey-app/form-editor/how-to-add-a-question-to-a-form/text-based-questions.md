# Text based questions

{% hint style="success" %}
Text based questions are questions which are responded to by entering text or numbers
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

Initially two text based question type are visible

* Text
* Long Text

## Step 2

Clicking on the ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (305) (1) (1) (1).png>)symbol beside the 'Text' label reveals some additional text based options

## Step 3

A text based question looks like this

## Step 4

Under 'Designation' give the question a label.

{% hint style="info" %}
The 'label' is how the questions will appear on the form. Make it as clear and concise as possible. Avoid long questions as they won't render well on small screens or mobiles
{% endhint %}

## Step 5

You can check the accessibility box if you want longer label (ie more than 100 characters). Checking this box will 'wrap' the text on multiple lines if needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be mindful that it is good practice to keep labels short and clear. Helper text can be used to provide additional information about the Question if needed
{% endhint %}

Selecting the 'more accessible label' option allows you to write the label in markdown: you can include style and even advanced html. This also allows to include tooltips for complex terms as below:

For example:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

renders as:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Step 6

The helper text appears under the question label when a respondent focusses on a question. It can be used to provide additional help to respondents when answering a specific question

## Step 7

Select the 'Validation' box if you require Respondents to answer the question

Respondents will not be able to 'Submit' the form unless all required feilds are completed

## Step 8

The other text based questions operate in the same way. The only differences are as follows:

* Currency and number questions provide an options for setting a maximum and minimum value for answers
* Date questions require Respondents to enter a date in the format dd/mm/yyyy
* Email questions require Respondents to enter a recognised email format ie the answer must include @ to be accepted
* Long text gives an option to set the number of rows that will be visible and the maximum number of rows that are available
