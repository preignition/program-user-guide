# Using Markdown

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
{% endhint %}

Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software and documentation pages.

Markdown is available in 'free text' feilds on the platform, giving you lots of control over how a free text feild is rendered.  You can format text and images and include tables and links and much more besides.

## Step 1

When you are in a free text field you will be notified that 'Markdown is supported'.  &#x20;

The link will take you to the Markdown page on Wikipedia where you will see some common examples of using markdown

The 'preview' feature shows you how the feild will appear to respondents.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Rendered as follows:

## Step 2

This example shows how to include a link
