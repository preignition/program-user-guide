# Access rights for forms

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the forms 'Owner' can set user rights to the form. &#x20;

In order to be given rights, a user must have an account on the application and be associated with your program.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

The user who creates the form is by default the forms 'Owner'.  Only 'Owners' can control who has access to edit, view and translate their forms.

Go to 'Access' in the left hand menu and select 'Add Users'

Choose the user you want to add and specify the role you would like them to have.

They will then appear in the 'User List' at the bottom of the page&#x20;

## Step 2

It is possible for a form 'Owner' to assign their ownership rights to another user.  This works in a similar way to adding a new user.
