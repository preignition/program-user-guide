## Anonymous Account

* This is the default &#x20;
* The respondent doesn't need to do anything
* Upon accepting the Terms of Service the application automatically creates an anonomous account on behalf of the respondent
* The respondent is invited to upgrade their account to a Personal Account once the survey is submitted
* This is best suited to public surveys where you do not need to control access or follow up with respondents

## Personal Accounts

* Respondents are asked to open an account prior to commencing a survey
* Accounts can be opened using an email and password or their google or facebook account if they have one
* &#x20;Best suited to surveys where you want to control access or follow up with respondents afterwards

## Verified Accounts

* Similar to a Personal Account
* In addition, Respondents will receive an email for verification purposes
* A link in the email needs to be clicked in order to complete the verification process. &#x20;
* The survey can be submitted without the verification process being complete
* Allows survey creators to check that accounts are being created with verified email addresses
