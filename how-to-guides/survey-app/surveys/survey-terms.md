# Survey terms- advanced

{% hint style="success" %}
Although this is an advanced feature, it is simple to add your own survey terms
{% endhint %}

## Context

In order to respond to a survey on the application, respondents must agree to the software providers terms of service.&#x20;

You have the option to ask respondents to agree to your own terms of service if you would like

## Step 1

To add your own survey terms, first toggle on the 'Advanced' settings.

You will see additional options appear in the Survey Definition menu, including 'Terms'
