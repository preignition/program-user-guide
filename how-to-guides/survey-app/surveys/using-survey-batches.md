# Survey batches

## Context

{% hint style="success" %}
In order for a survey to be active, it must be part of an active batch.  This means the batch must have a 'from' date which is in the past and a 'to' date which is in the future or left blank&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Batches provide a way to control when your survey is active by setting a 'from' and 'to' date.  Respondents clicking on a survey link outside of these date will be informed that the survey is closed.
* Batches also provided a way of grouping respondents based on when they completed a survey as the data set can be filtered by 'batch'.  This is helpful if you run an annual surveys and want to be able to analyse results by year. &#x20;

## Step 1

* Batch settings can be found under the 'Survey Definition' menu
