# Presenting surveys

## Context

{% hint style="success" %}
Your landing page allows you to briefly introduce your survey to respondents.  You can explain what your survey is about, how respondent's answers will be used and how long you estimate it will take to complete.  The landing page is also a good place to explain how you will use and protect your respondents' data, ensuring your survey is compliant with data protection rules such as the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/)
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

* 'Presentation' can be found in the 'Survey Definition' menu

There are three different presentation feilds:

**Landing page:**  Visible to a respondent when they first click on a survey link.  Can be used to introduce your survey.

**Survey context:**  Appears on a separate tab which is visible to respondents when they start a survey.  Can be used to provide more context for the survey.  This feild is optional.

**Thank you messsage:**  Can be used to provide a 'thank you' message to a respondent once they have completed a survey.  This feild is optional.

## Step 2

* Start by writing your 'Landing Page Presentation'.
* Markdown is supported and CSS Classes can be used to display or hide accessibility modes.
* The preview tab shows you how the page will appear to Respondents.  Currently accessibility modes need to be activated from the accessibility icon in the top menu

## Step 3

* This is how the 'short presentation' appears to respondents when they click on a survey link

## Step 4

* If you want you can write the text for the 'complementary presentation'
* Markdown is supported and CSS Classes can be used to display or hide accessibility modes.

## Step 5

* This is an example of how the 'complementary presentation' will appear to survey respondents

## Step 6


* Finally write a 'Thank you' message which will be shared with respondents once they have completed the survey
* Markdown is supported and CSS Classes can be used to display or hide accessibility modes

## Step 7

This is an example of how the 'Thank You Message' as written above, is presented to respondents when they have completed the survey.

## Step 8

* If additional languages have been activated for your survey, there will be an option to draft both the 'landing page presentation', 'complementary' presentation and 'Thanks You Message' in the other languages
* Select the language for translation

* And write the translation in the additional feilds that appear
