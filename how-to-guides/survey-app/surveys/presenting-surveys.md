# Presenting surveys

## Context

{% hint style="success" %}
Your landing page allows you to briefly introduce your survey to respondents.  You can explain what your survey is about, how respondent's answers will be used and how long you estimate it will take to complete.  The landing page is also a good place to explain how you will use and protect your respondents' data, ensuring your survey is compliant with data protection rules such as the EU's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr.eu/)
{% endhint %}
