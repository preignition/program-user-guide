## Step 2

The name you have given to your form will appear under both 'name' and 'title'.  You can edit it here.

&#x20;**Name -** This is for internal purposes.  It won't be visible to respondents

**Title -** This will appear on the top of your form and will be visible to respondents.  You will be able to translate your title if you set your form to be multi-lingual

## Step 3

If you have many forms you might want use 'Labels' to organise them. &#x20;

Labels are explained in a seperate 'how to' guide.

## Step 4

The application automatically creates the first page of your form.  This appears on the tree structure of your survey on the left side of the screen. &#x20;

In the example above the first page is named 'About you'.

You have the option to start working on this page or add a new page by selecting the 'add new page' button.

## Step 5

To edit a page, highlight it in the tree structure.

You can ammend the page name and provide a page sub title

Pages are organised into sections and question are added to sections. &#x20;

In the example above the first section is named 'first section'&#x20;

You have the option to start working on this section or add a new section by selecting the 'add new section' button.
