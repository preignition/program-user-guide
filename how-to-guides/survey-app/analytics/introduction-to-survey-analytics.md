# Introduction to survey analytics

{% hint style="info" %}
Survey analytics provides an visual overview of the response to a survey.  It updates in real time and allows users to filter their dataset based on criteria they define, eg show responses by date, location or based on answers to a specific question.

Data can be exported to a specialist platform for in-depth statistical analysis &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

The 'Analytics' feild shows recent activity on the survey's active batch.

Clicking on this feild takes you into survey analytics

## Step 2

The main analytics page is divided into two sections:

**Meta feilds:**  This contains survey information which is not related to the survey reponses themselves.  This includes information such as when a response was received, the language it was submitted in or where the respondent was located.  Fields in this section stay stable when a user navigates through different pages of the survey

**Pages:**  This contains the responses to the survey questions themselves.   You will see the page structure of your survey on the left hand side under the heading 'Pages'.  You can use the page structure to naviage through your survey. &#x20;

## Step 3

The elements on the analytics dashboard are interactive.  Meaning feilds in both the meta and page sections act both as a visualization tool, with charts displaying its distribution over the dataset, and as a filtering tool.&#x20;

This provides a simple yet extremely powerful tool to interact with collected data, and instantaneously visualize the sub-dataset according to users' own criteria (like, how does data look for for Africa, or for just for users answering `yes` to question `X`, or any combination of available information), just by clicking on categories of the chart.

We used an advanced ordering algorithm for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. It will support extremely fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing millions of records.

In the example below we can look at responses from India, who submitted their survey in Hindi and answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you consider yourself to be a person with a disability'

## Step 4

Filters can be cleared by clicking on the filter option on in the 'details' feild or under the feild where the filter has been applied

## Step 5

Feilds from the 'Pages' section can be pinned to the top section of the page.  This means that they remain visible as you scroll through the survey and are readily available to filter the dataset. &#x20;

Feild can be unpinned at any time.

## Step 6

Each feild can be viewed as a chart or as raw data

## Step 7

In the future you will be able to customise the chart type, colours and positioning&#x20;
