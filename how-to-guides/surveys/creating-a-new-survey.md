# Creating a new survey

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Forms decide **what** information you collect from your Respondents

Surveys decide **how** you collect that information
{% endhint %}

Survey settings allow you to do the following:

* Select the Form to be used in a survey
* Create links to distribute your survey
* Design a landing page to present your survey
* Decide user rights for your survey
* Specify any Terms you need Respondents to agree to before answering your survey

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to 'Publish' your survey so any changes you have made are actived for new respondents (see step 10 for how to publish)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

To create a new survey select 'Survey' from the Resource Type list and 'Create New Survey'

## Step 5

Under the 'Batch' tab you can determine when your survey is open and closed.  It can be used to group your survey respondents into batches.

This is covered in a seperate How to Guide called 'Using Survey Batches'

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not necessary to use the batch feature.  An initial batch with an open start and end date is created by default
{% endhint %}

## Step 6

The 'presentation' tab allows you to give your survey a title and create a page which respondents will land on before agreeing to Terms of Use annd starting the survey.

Mark down is supported, so images and videos can be incorporated.   See a seperate How To Guide called 'Options available in free text feilds'&#x20;

## Step 8

The 'terms' tab enables you ask your respondents to agree to your terms before responding to your survey

{% hint style="info" %}
It is your choice whether to ask respondents to agree to your own terms.  By default, users will have to agree to Preigntion's terms of service before responding to a survey.
{% endhint %}

To add your own terms toggle the button 'add survey terms' and write your terms.  As in most text feilds in the app, Markdown is supported

The 'Activity' tab gives an overview of recent activity on the survey.

## Step 10

You need to 'publish' your survey for new respondents to see any changes that you have made to your survey.

To publish your survey simply press the blue 'Publish' button in the top right corner.

A notification message confirming that the resouce has been published will appear.
