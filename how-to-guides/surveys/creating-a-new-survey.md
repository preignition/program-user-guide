# Creating a new survey

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
Forms decide **what** information you want to collect from your Respondents

Surveys decide **how** you collect that information
{% endhint %}

Survey settings allow you to do the following:

* Select the Form to be used in a survey
* Create links to distribute your survey
* Design a landing page to present your survey
* Decide user rights for your survey
* Specify any Terms you need Respondents to agree to before answering your survey

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to 'Publish' your survey so any changes you have made are actived for new respondents (see [step 10](creating-a-new-survey.md#step-10) for how to publish)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

To create a new survey select 'Survey' from the Resource Type list and 'Create New Survey'

## Step 2

Give your new survey a name

## Step 3

Under the 'settings' tab you can edit the survey name and select the form you want to use to collect data

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (309) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 4

Under the 'Distribute' tab there is a tool for generating links to you survey.

This is covered in a seperate How To Guide called '[Generating survey links](generating-survey-links.md)'

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (299) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 5

Under the 'Batch' tab you can determine when your survey is open and closed.  It can be used to group your survey respondents into 'batches'.

This is covered in a seperate How to Guide called '[Using survey batches](using-survey-batches.md)'

{% hint style="warning" %}
An initial batch is created by default with an open 'end date'.  To activate this batch you will need to enter a 'from date'
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (312) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 6

The 'Presentation' tab allows you to give your survey a title and create a page which respondents will land on before agreeing to the Terms of Use and starting the survey.

Mark down is supported, so images and videos can be incorporated.   See the How To Guide called 'Using free text feilds'&#x20;

&#x20;

## Step 7

The 'Access' tab allows you to control user rights for the survey

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (300) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 8

The 'Terms' tab enables you ask your respondents to agree to your terms before responding to your survey

{% hint style="info" %}
It is your choice whether to ask respondents to agree to your own terms.  By default, users will have to agree to Preigntion's terms of service before responding to a survey.
{% endhint %}

For more information, see the How to Guide 'Survey Terms'

## Step 9

The 'Activity' tab gives an overview of recent activity on the survey.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (306) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Step 10

{% hint style="success" %}
You need to 'Publish' your survey in order for new respondents to see any changes that you have made to your survey.
{% endhint %}

To publish your survey simply press the blue 'Publish' button in the top right corner.

A notification message confirming that the resouce has been published will appear.
