# Presenting surveys

## Context

{% hint style="success" %}
Respondents want some information about your survey before completing it. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Presentation tab allows you to customise how you present your survey to respondents

* The 'short presentation' appears when respondents click on a survey link.  It can be used to introduce the survey to respondents
* The 'complementary presentation' appears on a seperate tab and can be used to give more details about the survey.  It can be accessed by respondents at any time

## Step 1

* Write the text for the 'short presentation'
* Markdown is supported so you can customize the look and feel of your text

## Step 2

* This is how the 'short presentation' appears to respondents when they click on a survey link

## Step 3

* Write the text for the 'complementary presentation'
* Again, markdown is supported
* It is possible to insert images or videos.  See the the seperate 'How To' guide

## Step 4

* This is how the 'complementary presentation' will appear to survey respondents

## Step 5

* If the survey will be shared in other languages, there will be an option to draft both the 'short presentation' and 'complementary' presentation in the other languages
* Select the language for translation

* And write the translation in the additional feilds that appear
