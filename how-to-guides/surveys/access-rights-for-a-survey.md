# Access rights for a survey

{% hint style="success" %}
The access tab enables you to define ownership and user rights for a particular survey so any changes to the survey are made by authorised users
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

* The 'access' tab shows the existing user roles for the survey
* The person who created the survey will be the default 'Survey Owner'

## Step 2

* To change the survey owner select 'modify ownership'&#x20;
* Select the user you want to transfer ownership to
* The user must already have an account on the app which is associated with your organisation

## Step 3

* It is possible to add users to the survey with different levels of user rights

## Step 4

* User rights can be revoked at any time by users with a high level of authorisation

**Editor**- Has full rights on the survey.  Can not modify ownership

**Viewer**- Has rights to view the survey.  Can not add or revoke other users

**Translator**- Has the rights to view the survey and edit the survey in a specified language.  Can not add or revoke other users.&#x20;
