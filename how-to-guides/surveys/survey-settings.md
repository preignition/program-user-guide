# Survey settings

## Introduction

The survey 'settings' menu is where you name the survey and select a form to be used to collect data in the survey

## Step 1

The section at the top of the page provides details of when the survey was created, last updated, last published and who the owner is

The designation section is where the survey name can be edited

Like with all resources, surveys can be organized using labels.  See the seperate How to Guide called '[Using labels](../../settings/using-labels.md)'

## Step 2

Form enables you to embed a form into the survey.  The form needs to have been 'published' before it can be used in a survey

## Step 3

Once you have selected a form you will be asked whether you want to always use the current version of the form or whether you want to use a specifc version

{% hint style="info" %}
In most cases you will want to use the current version of the form.  However there maybe times, such as when a form is being updated, when it makes sense to use an previous version
{% endhint %}

## Step 4

The activation feild describes whether the survey is currently 'active'.   The survey must be active in order for responses to be saved to the database.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for a survey to be active, the batch settings must have a 'from date' which is in the past and a 'to date' which is in the future or left blank.  The survey must also be published
{% endhint %}
