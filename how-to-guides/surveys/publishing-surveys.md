# Publishing surveys

{% hint style="success" %}
Surveys need to be 'published' in order for respondents to see any changes that have been made to the survey
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

You can publish a survey by selecting 'publish' in the top right

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (306) (1).png>)

## Step 2

You will receive a notification that the survey has been published and the 'last published' date will be updated

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (314) (1).png>)

## Step 3

A survey can be unpublished at any time from the survey settings page.  This will unactivate the survey, meaning that it can no longer be responded to.

It can republished at any time.
